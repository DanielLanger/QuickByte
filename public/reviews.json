The area resembles the old shopping strip-meets-new shopping strip of San Luis Obispo.  What they did -- or so I've been told -- is that they've managed to preserve the old strip, leaving it looking the way it presumably did in the 70s.  Rhino Records is located in the older part.  The Back Abbey in the new part.  Both distinct areas of their aesthetic and consumer pull. \n\nThe Back Abbey specializes in Belgian draft beer.  They carry some German and English beer, as well.\n\nWow, the selection of beer. Let me tell you! A lof of them I have never heard of. I tasted the Augustijn (Belgian) and the Hofbrau Original (German).  Both were good, but I prefer the Hofbrau.They come in different sized glasses, with the Hofbrau coming in a long glass. The Augustijn was $9, and the Hofbrau $6. The Hofbrau came in the larger glass, so the Augustijn must be considered some premium brew for it to be in a smaller glass and come knocking down doors at a mighty $9.  \n\nI liked the overall aesthetics of the place. There is an up-close-and-personal feel to the bar. Along with the standard bar and barstools set-up, there's a long table that goes from one end of the bar to the other. People sit across from each other and, since the tables are not wide, you're not far at all from the person sitting in front of you. Like I wrote earlier, up close and personal is what this bar has going for it.\n\nThey have a food menu, as well. Above their draft selection of beer, they have a chalkboard placed high up with a list of what they serve. For those veggies among us, they even make a veggie burger.\n\nLastly, the patrons all seem to know each other. Maybe it's the small town mentality. But it's not exactly a backwards, hick town. It's very much modern in certain ways, and people just love to talk. Couple that with brew, and there's a lot of talk going on.\n\nI had a discussion with someone at the bar, who bartends at a bar not too far from The Back Abbey, and he told me that the Augustijn is the oldest beer recipe known to man. (Ah, ok. Old is vintage. Vintage is expensive. Thus, Augustijn is expensive.  And two + two = four. I got this down, partna'.)   Again, can we give it up for \"up close and personal\"?\n\nAnd, lastly, the bartenders were very attentive and enjoyed talking about the difference between the brews. The goateed gentlemen was specifically patient in describing which ones were Belgian, German, and English.\n\nThe mantra of this review should be \"up close and personal.\"  This is what this 4-star bar is all about.", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"},

Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.\n\nAll of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.\n\nMy server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn't charged.\n\nI don't blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few \"vegetarians\" who just don't eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. \n\nSo, it's up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we're not totally sure. And this is probably wise at any place where there is an ethnic and language barrier (On a related note, don't be fooled into thinking you can get vegan pho in Philly. It does not exist.

In both cases, the provided services were at an 'acceptable' level. Nothing special but equating to other companies. My eventual overall dissatisfaction arose from multiple cases of what started off as relatively minor problems.\n\nIn each case, what I thought of as relatively minor problems, grew into unresolvable beasts, when I had a need to contact CUSTOMER SERVICE (and I use that term very loosely). I don't know that they still do so, but I learned to cringe when they answered the phone with, \"How may I provide you with excellent service?\". It got to the point that my standard opening response was, \"I'll accept decent service\". \n\nWithout going further into details, I haven't had business with them for over 3 years now, that said... they have come back, uninvited, into my life.\n\nMy credit monitoring service recently contacted me with a notice of unusual activity. Investigating, I discovered that a collection company out of Florida had placed an unpaid bill of $33 on my credit report. There were no details but digging deeper, I went to http://annualcreditreport.com/ and found that it was associated with an AT&T claim.\n\nAs much as I dislike AT&T, I ALWAYS pay my bills (assuming I'm aware of them). I'm still investigating, but, this is just another check box confirming to NEVER again consider purchasing ANY service from AT&T.\n\nTheir sales people will say all the right things. Their brochures are shiny and refined. Their commercials are alluring.

Moreover, there was only one other party in the entire restaurant, and my first thought that this place wouldn't be that good (I usually associate how good the food is by the amount of people in the restaurant). \n\nHowever, once we sat down, the table was pretty clean.

With the quickness: though they make each order right in front of you, it never seems to take more than a few minutes and I am promptly on my way out the door with my lunch in hand.\n\n2. On the cheap. For the most part, cheap makes a sacrifice of quality to some degree and Wrapro is no exception. The lamb is sometimes chewy and the pita they give with the hummus has been stale on more than one occasion. But for less than $7 and a ton of food, it's still a good deal.\n\n3. Easy - the menu is laid out is a simply manner and it's a few minutes walk from my house. Does not get easier than that@\n\nA few points of concern. I am one of those people who writes, in sharpie, \"Please See ID\" on the back of my cards. The man behind the counter once gave me a lecture about this. Dude, I just want some lunch, not a complete credit counseling sesh. Also, the last time I was in, I was given the wrong order and the woman helping me huffed, puffed and mumbled something, then proceeded to charge me the $1.25 difference in price. When I handed my card over (I rarely carry cash), she rolled her eyes and asked if I had any cash. Not the best customer service.\n\nI continue to grab lunch here on occasion, but I've set my expectations to a certain degree and now I am rarely disappointed by Wrapro.", "business_id": "rKirSxY1-ScGEzQjfYSI2A"},

We dont get out to Claremont too often, but when we do, there is always a new destination for dining. This time, happened to be Eureka! Burger. While we knew the restaurant was located inside the Packing House, totally unexpected to the small size of the place. This was on a Saturday night around 6:45 PM and our wait was estimated for about an hour and fifteen minutes. A little more than I expected, but we put our name in anyways. Pretty niffty that they will actually send you a text message when your table is being prepated. So, the wait actually ended up being around 45 minutes. Not too bad. \n\nStarted with the wings, and the sample of beers. Wings were great and enjoyed the housemade dressing for those. The craft brew selection appears fantastic, just from the four samples I ordered. The one IPA was actually really really good. Wish I could recall which it was. Ordered the Classic Eureka Burger and the Catalina Burger. My wife described her burger to be not much better than a traditonal restaurant burger. Even at ordering the cooking temp to medium. I thought the Catalina Burger was great. The bison was lean, but packed full of flavor compared to the classic beef in the Eureka Burger. The shoestring fries were fresh and seasoned well.

Nevertheless I will provide information on that.\n\nI learned about Dr. Tobinick via a Youtube video his office uploaded.  I made an appointment for a free consultation; his office is in the UCLA medical plaza  They had me first watch a video detailing his unique procedure which, he claims, will eliminate pain associated with a herniated disc (in about 70% of patients).\n\nI have a herniated disc in my neck.  The pain is much less than it was a year ago, but still I have pain every day and so I'd like to have my condition corrected.  I only take Aleve or aspirin on \"bad days.\"  I didn't see Dr. Tobinick but rather one of his associate MD's - Dr. Reyzin.  The staff said Dr. Tobinick was in Florida.\n\nAnyway, Dr. Reyzin said I was a candidate for this procedure.  The next step would be to schedule a complete examination and physical test - cost $300.00.  The procedure then costs $3,000.00 - $5,000.00.  That's a lot for a 10 minute procedure but if it works it would be worth it.  I have health insurance and I'll have to see if they'll cover this.\n\nI came home and tried to find some negative (or positive) info about Dr. Tobinick on the web; I couldn't find much of either.  I'll keep searching.  I'll update this review if I decide to have this procedure done.  My gut feeling tells me something is not right with regard to Dr. Tobinick's claims.  If 70% of patients had their pain eliminated, wouldn't every spine doctor be performing this procedure?  Or perhaps, maybe the procedure works but after several months to a year, the pain comes back (which is typically what happens when steroids are injected into a herniated disc).", "business_id": "FXpHCkccct8SJjN9r1BvPw"},

I don't know why, but people really make a big deal about this place. Best Thai food in Seattle? Maybe if all the more spacious and comfortable ones in the area are somehow inferior. That's not to say this place is anything short of excellent, or that I doubt in its ability to stand up to the competition. The food here is simply outstanding. Whether it's a better Thai restaurant than all the other ones in town is another question, but what is certain is that you really can't go wrong with any money spent here.\n\nBecause I knew how popular this place is and how limited the seating would be, I anticipated it getting full shortly after opening. I stood outside and waited until 11:30 AM with a handful of other eager customers. By 11:35, nearly every seat was taken. It was then that I realized I was dealing with serious business. While I was lucky enough to be seated, I saw the waiter turn away a few people and ask them to come back later because there just wasn't enough space to accomodate them. I don't know whether to be impressed by that, but if they're so successful, I wonder why they can't afford to get a bigger place.\n\nThe place itself, if the other reviews haven't made it obvious by now, is constantly busy and crowded. It looks old, worn out, and generally unpleasant. But it's a restaurant and not a museum where you marvel at artwork. The air here is pretty much always thick with the smell of delicious fried food. The kitchen isn't in its own separate room way in the back and out of the public eye; the cooks make your food right in front of your eyes. Consequently, it can also get rather hot, especially if you sit by the fires. But all this food is definitely worth the trouble. No matter how long you have to wait, you can be entertained by the aroma of other customers' meals and the display of the food being made.\n\nSince so much of the fun of eating here comes from watching the cooks make everything, I'd suggest getting one of the seats at the counter near the front of the restaurant, kind of in the corner. It's a spectacular display, although not as ostentatious as teppanyaki. The cooks' hands move with astounding speed. They'll grab from the ingredients around them, crack eggs single-handedly, and noisily clatter the woks around as they perform all their cooking in a seemingly effortless manner. It's nice being able to see exactly how all this food is prepared, especially if it's obvious that it's being done by people who clearly have a lot of experience.\n\nThe menu here is something of an oddity. Instead of the usual thin and light paper menus, the ones here appear to be entirely painted on wooden planks. My first instinct was actually to take it as a joke, but I realize that it may have been a stylistic choice. I suppose they're really going for that authentic Thai feel here. From the rather brief list of hardly more than thirty items, I ordered the Phad Thai for $7.50. This restaurant is supposedly top-tier, but I wanted to get the most basic dish before venturing onward to their more \"specialized\" delicacies. I got it with chicken and three stars on the spicy scale from one to five.\n\nAlthough there was quite a long queue of customers who had already placed their orders before I could get a chance to, it's almost not a concern because it was such a delight watching the guy cooking the meals jump from making one person's dish to another. It's amazing how he never seemed to mess up, too. On numerous occasions, it looked like he was stirring the food too carelessly and would make a mess, but he always seemed to catch it in his wok. The show had an almost mesmerizing quality to it. I don't know why I get such a kick out of watching one person multitask so efficiently. It's an entirely missed opportunity if you get seated at one of the tables to the side, away from where all the action is taking place. For this reason, I would not recommend coming here with too large and cumbersome of a group. Either way, it's quite possible to get seated right next to a complete stranger here.\n\nMy much-awaited lunch arrived with the chicken Phad Thai on one side of a long bowl, a clump of white rice occupying the other side, and a wedge of lime adjacent to all this. Sizzling in front of me, it looked and smelled like quite a feast, although I couldn't help but notice that it was... disappointingly small. To be fair, it was a very inexpensive dish, but insufficient as a whole meal for a voracious eater like me. All petty complaints, because the food itself was without a doubt among the best of Thai cuisine I've ever experienced. A sweet taste was dominant with this Phad Thai; I guess they had skimped on the spiciness, but I won't hold it against them. I may have exaggerated the flaws, but they're all insignificant when you consider that this is just about as close to perfection for Thai food in Seattle to feasibly reach.", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"},

I would only return to Eureka if The Back Abbey had an hour+ wait, or if I just wanted a beer sans burger (the bar seemed pretty chill).\n\nSo why did I give Eureka 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and she gave me an awesome beer recommendation (I had a \"White Rascal,\" which tasted like a more delicious Hoegaarden). She also hooked us up with the delicious truffle sauce stuff for our fries that came with the burgers for only $2 instead of making us order the $7.50 \"Eureka Truffle Fries\" appetizer. The restaurant has several big-screen TVs, which is much better than The Back Abbey's one small TV at the bar if you want to watch a game. They also had some pleasant, mellow live music. The burgers were roughly $9-10, which is about $2-3 less than the burgers at The Back Abbey, and they came with fries, whereas The Back Abbey's burgers do not. My beer was $5, which is way cheaper than the average beer at The Back Abbey (this price difference is not surprising though since \"White Rascal\" is from an American brewery).\n\nBasically, I was hoping that Eureka would be The Back Abbey plus a hostess and a larger waitstaff, but their burgers just weren't up to snuff.

I normally like a strong garlic taste, however the garlic on the bruschette was more of a mild nutty garlic flavor but still so tasty! The tomato&basil bruschette was typical and nothing too special. The caprese salad was also very good, had fresh mozzarella and pesto.  Then we got our scallops and cauliflower, and I know everyone raves about the scallop, but the scallops were just good, not extraordinary. On the other hand, the cauliflower was AMAZING! I don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but if everyone made cauliflower like this, kids wouldn't have any problems eating their veggies! We got our bacaro burgers, with the egg of course, and it was a unique way to eat a burger, but unique in a good way. By the end of all our small plates, we were incredibly stuffed. Thought the small plates wouldn't be enough to fill us but I think we were definitely wrong. Still we couldn't leave without trying the bread pudding and OMGGGG i'm drooling as I type,,, i definitely had a mouthgasm *sigh it's super fluffy, buttery, with a soft texture yet some of the ends of the little mushy bread pieces were crispy all topped off with a heavenly scoop of vanilla ice cream.

My favorite nights are Thursday for the great jazz bands and Sundays when they feature a solo pianist. Food in front, beer in hand... Nothin' better.\n\nThe food is amazing - gourmet quality and an excellent selection. Especially for someone who leans toward vegetarian, but they don't discriminate. Some of my favorites include:\n-The Breakfast Burrito, a more-than-hearty package of potato, eggs, and cheese. Comes with salsa. Perfect for a Saturday morning with a Bloody Mary, or any other time of any other day (it's on the late night menu!). I usually add avocado. Classic.\n-The Dijon Chicken, creamy, savory completely satisfying. Sub the chicken for tofu if that's your thing.\n-The Veggie Burger. Or the Eggplant Burger. Or any burger really. So good. \n-The Taco Salad. It's hearty, it's pretty healthy, and it's so so good.\n-The desserts! Bread Pudding, Vegan Chocolate Cake, Mocha Torte especially. Ask for some of Dr. Bob's ice cream on the side! Expletive, that is incredible.\n\nDrink selection is pretty killer too. They have monthly special martinis, but I usually go for their great beer selection.\n-Dale Bros beer! Not only is it local to Upland, but the beer is so good! I've made many converts to their brews, from the classic Pomona Queen to their special brews like the incredible California Black Beer.\n-Chimay White, and cheaper than it is at The Back Abbey a few blocks down.\n-Wine Wednesday.

I hope that comes across.\n\nI'm sad to see that some people have had some bad experiences, especially Mister X (I don't totally agree with all of Molly Z's review, if they run out of stuff it's because they purchase local, they're not a \"wine restaurant\" they are a restaurant, they don't have tablecloths at the bar tables, etc. - none of that is unreasonable). There's no denying that they had some bad experiences though.\n\nAnd that's a shame. The place is a rare combo of excellent food, drink, and culture. I hope those reviewers can take some solace in that the restaurant takes those critiques and any other comments they get very seriously, and work to improve the place and their service, as any good restaurant should.

With such a grand sign in those great two colors, I had to give it a try before I completely moved out of town. When a 4-star average on Yelp, I had pretty high expectations going in.\n\nUnfortunately, these expectations were not met, and my overall dining experience was mediocre. I got a Georgia Reuben, a sandwich I have enjoyed many times from Zingerman's and Dimo's.\n\nFor the same price, at Dimo's I can get a sandwich that's twice as big and frankly twice as good. I wonder if the high average of M&B is due to the fact many of the students reviewing it have never ventured out to Stadium. I'm amazed by how many people here are raving about the size of the sandwiches...I peaked at the couple next to me and there's were also the same size as mine...while they pack in a decent amount of meat, I wasn't even completely full and needed to grab a slice of pizza a few hours later. Dimo's has never failed to completely fill me up (you get chips in addition to a pickle there). Zingerman's Georgia Reuben or Tom's New Job, while far more expensive so perhaps not a fair comparison, are still far superior sandwichs.\n\nUltimately a lot of this comes down to ingredients. Both Dimo's and Zingerman's use their own bread...while Dimo's bread isn't world-renowned like Zingerman's, its still huge and guaranteed always since they make it themselves. M&B's bread was mediocre bread-aisle bread. Meh. For a Georgia Reuben, having crisp bread is key.\n\nI didn't feel the other ingredients blended that well together. While the turkey wasn't by any means bad, it lacked its own taste...it just felt bland. The cheese wasn't well melted and the Russian dressing sauce was lacking. It mainly felt like I was using bread to eat a lot of turkey with my hands. For the price I paid, I was expecting a more holistic sandwich experience.\n\nThe place itself is nice enough; its small, with the menu taking up an entire wall and a TV in the corner. Props to them for offering so many types of sandwiches. The service was fine--they bring the sandwich to you which is a nice touch.\n\nI would appreciate it if the sandwiches were larger, ingredients (esp bread) were better, sandwiches were warmed/cooked more, and came with chips. That's a lot to ask for. Would I return? Probably not. There are too many other great options on South U to pass up, and if I want a sandwich, I'll head over to Dimo's or Zingerman's.\n\nGo blue though!", "business_id": "GqqBWV8ysYB48_jLPMl2bA"},

And when they mean smaller, it really is alot smaller. But it was still good enough for me. THe fleming potatoes was literally 2inx1inx.5in. it was basically a sliver of the regular order. haha. The filet mignon was very tender and flavorful. I didnt see anythign special abotu the steak though. It reminded me alot of texas roundhouse. A little bit on the salty side, and i could REALLY taste the pepper (im a pepper lover so i was happy). We also had the prefixed winter meal. \nIt was a filet mignon: same as my order-it had alot of chopped up onion, mushrooms and bacon to top it off. i think it made it even saltier\ncaesar- its ard to mess up on a salad, i was satisfied\nparmesan mashed potatoes: very tasty, but they mix in MORE butter, i almost had a heart attack. \nthen the meal also came with cookiesand milk. I didnt have anymore room for dessert, so this was very satisying.\n\nthe service was decent.

As somebody who has lived in Japan for some time I like that the variety of authentic Japanese teas and specific food items.

Bland and boring to say the least, but the commoners will probably like it (if you've ever ordered a California Roll then I'm talking to you).  I personally don't get sushi here, I come for the freshly made ichigo daifuku (a dessert of rice paste enclosing a glob of sweet bean paste and a strawberry); they're orgasmic.  They best I ever had were in Hokkaido, but the ones here are easily comparable to those I could get in Tokyo or Boston.  \n\nThe people here are really great (friendly, helpful, informed, etc.) and most (perhaps all) of the staff speak Japanese which is nice for me too.  The decor is strange.  Most of it is very starched and plain -- uncomfortably white and hospital-like.  But then it is combined with an authentic Japanese garden fountain and the bamboo highlighted booth-like seats and such.  I've been there for lunch a few times and it was okay, I really recommend it for tea and daifuku.  \n\nI also really appreciate them being open until 8:00PM on Christmas Eve, everything else was closed at 6:00 and I wanted to get some work done in a cafe like I always do.

We ordered a pistachio-vanilla swirl with cookie dough and shared it.  \n\nAnyway, it was good, but I didn't quite get what the big fuss was about.  However, I defer to her judgement on the matter, as she considers herself to be quite the conoisseur of frozen yogurt and other desserts.  \n\nThe only other fro-yo place I can name off the top of my head is Fraiche, in Pacific Heights, which she also goes on and on about.

Yes, it was that great!  From start to finish...service, to food, even price point...I can't imagine it getting any better than this!\n\n   My sister had found a deal for Il Palio of 3 courses including a bottle of wine for $59.99 per COUPLE.  Their regular price for their 3-course menu is $39.99 per person with no wine.  So, quite a deal!  We made reservations and showed up tonight (Saturday night) for our 6:30 reservations to a relatively empty dining room with servers standing around. (note: it got busy soon thereafter).\n\n  We were offered tap or bottled water (we chose tap, with no snooty reaction when that was our choice), and served an amuse bouche before we knew it. It was a wonderful smoked trout with beans bruschetta.  Delicious.  Between the four of us (one drank beer...he was the designated driver), we ordered a bottle of red and a bottle of white.  With our deal we had a choice of 3 whites and 3 reds. We went with the chardonnay and the cabernet.  The wine guy here is awesome!  Friendly, and well, perfect service! I LOVED that he gave each of us wine drinkers a glass for the red and a glass for the white and served them at the same time, so WE could choose what went best with which foods.  He presented wine the \"proper\" way without it feeling stuffy and pretentious.  Truly memorable! And we liked both of them very much.\n\n    We were brought two kinds of bread with a pea puree/pesto type spread that was light and delicious, topped off with a nice quality olive oil.  Both breads were excellent...one of which was a sundried tomato focaccia...  the other was just a good basic bread that was probably my favorite.\n\n    For our deal menu, we had our choice between three first courses, four seconds, and two desserts.  We two gals went with the blue crab ravioli, the stuffed trout, and the peach daiquiri dessert.  Guys went with the bolognese tagliatelle and, the steak dish, and the panna cotta dessert.\n\n   I wish their website was working tonight (it hasn't been working all day), or I would quote accurate descriptions of these amazing dishes, but let me just say that they were all PERFECT, fresh, and amazing!  I have had trout at The Mint in Raleigh that was flat-out awful.  This trout was unbelievably good! It was stuffed with spinach and onions and fontina and cooked to perfection. The white asparagus with it was just the right texture with a nice tangy balsamic that went so well with the rich fish.  I've never cared for fish skin before but this was crispy and beyond delicious.  I tell you, this chef needs to go on Chopped or Iron Chef, and please let me be a judge!  I could go on and on, but I wasn't the only one happy. We ALL were.  The bolognese was full of flavor and the homemade pasta was cooked perfectly al dente..loved the little spice kick to it. Ravioli with fava beans...rich and a very generous serving...the tomatoes in the dish were the perfect sweet/acidic addition.  Guys LOVED their steaks. I managed to steal a tiny taste before I was almost stabbed with a fork (just kidding).  It was GREAT.  They all raved about the mushrooms (I don't do mushrooms, so I can't relate), and the side dish was a green creamy delicious treat that I cannot properly describe nor properly name.\n\n    Coffee...excellent.  Dessert...again, very good. The peach one was a little parfait glass layered with creamy, fruity goodness, served next to a \"rum baba\".  Uh, what?  It was a small dinner roll that had supposedly been soaked in rum? It wasn't overpowering though, so all I know was, it was good cut up and put in the dish with the creamy fruit.  The panna cotta with blueberry sauce was also good, with a crunchy cookie type topping.\n\n   Now, not only was service excellent, but we never even had to show our discount \"postcard\".  The discount was taken off our bill automatically.  Even with a more than twenty percent tip that we happily paid, this dinner was well under $100 for two.  \n\n    We will not only be back, but will continue to rave about this meal for a long time!", "business_id": "dje3fr7pL6_OjA_OhFasKA"},

There was only one other group there at the time so seating wasn't an issue. The place seems to be fairly low key Sunday mornings (or at least this morning). Waiter was awesome; very friendly and attentive. The layout is pretty open so even on a full day it wouldn't be crammed (common complaint for some brunch places).   \n\nI ordered the Go Green! egg-white Scramble (basil-marinated portobella / fried green tomatoes / fresh mozzarella / basil cashew pesto) and my friend got the Kathy Bates Bennie (Eggs benedict that consists of 2 crispy oat waffles, fried green tomatoes, poached eggs,  hollandaise-of course-and avocado smash). Portions were very generous. Eating buddy loved his eggs benedict. I had a bite myself and they were yummy. I liked my scramble as well. Sweet potato latkas were good; very comfort food-like. My only critique was the amount of liquid in my plate. I'm guessing cooking with that much veggies, some fluid comes out but it made the eggs a little wetter than I would have liked (mostly an issue towards the end of the meal). It was all still delicious but definitely would have liked less water. The excess water could have also accounted for the egg tasting a bit bland. To be fair, I love salty so I am very sensitive to food that is under-salted even a tad. \n\nAnyway I would certainly come back! I really would like to try a waffle next time (got my eye on the sweet cinnamon waffle with nutella ice cream). We both enjoyed our brunch and its very chill ambiance provided an ideal place for my college friend and I to catch up on life.", "business_id": "MApTrkJdMvtJB59DqzLUGQ"},

Rachel, or I guess she also goes by Raquel, did my hair. I wanted a Brazilian Keratin Treatment on my natural hair, but I decided to try them out with a wash and set first. They got my hair really straight, and at first I was really pleased with how straight they got my nautral hair! I was happy until the next time I washed my hair. Clumps of my hair came out. CLUMPS. Like ten 1-2 inch balls of hair all over the shower floor.  And really long clumps, like it was either breaking from near the root or coming out like shedding. I nearly cried in the shower. My hair continued to shed like this for two more washings. :-(\n\nFlashback. The only thing I'd done differently to my hair in the past few days was go to this salon. I asked for a wash and set. The lady (not Rachel) washed my hair, my natural hair, very vigorously so as to knot it up. Mistake number one. Then, mistake number two, she tried to comb it from the root out! Yeah, that didnt work! All I heard was my hair snapping, snarling and breaking. I had to break out my Denman brush and show her the way. Then, in Spanish...  and I hate this! I hate when they talk in Spanish around you. It's very rude. But I speak Spanish, so I understood her when she told the other hairdresser how tough my hair was. I'm thinking, \"Oh boy, here we go again...\" She then offered to put a \"hot oil treatment\" in my hair, for free! Rachel recommended it too. I obliged.\n\nFast forward to the roller set. She needed help to roll my hair (too coily for her :-( ). Rachel took over at this point. Then when blow drying I keep hearing my poor strands snapping and breaking. The end result was typical, dead straight and really flat with a little curl at the end and lots of shining oils. I'm not a fan. :-( But I pay the bill and tip her well. Then the next time I wash my hair, it fell out in clumps and the texture was different. It was more rough and a lot less coily. Some parts were wavy. I'm positive it was the \"hot oil treatment\" that caused the clumps of hair to fall out. Anyhow, that was my first and last experience with them. You have been warned!!! BTW, this experience was in July 2011.", "business_id": "C58LwszasVKIqFsKfQhIGA"},

Friday's used to have one of the better happy hours in the general UCSD area, but ever since switching to the new Sunday and bar only specials, there isn't much point for students to go to enjoy some good deals on appetizers and drinks after a late night of studying or for their friends' birthdays.  This particular trip was inspired by a friends' birthday celebration and was a throwback to our old student days.\n\nFeeling a bit hungrier than just an appetizer, I decided to go with the Cheesy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Accompanied by a \"Snakebite\", this combination makes for the classic burger and beer combo.  The burger was pretty tasty and moist, but what makes this burger unique is its inclusion of a sliced of fried provolone cheese.  You would expect that it be kind of melted, but it was sort of just a solid patty of fried cheese.  It was OK, but definitely not what I expected.  I found the fries to be disappointingly over seasoned as well.\n\nTurning away their core demographic is a silly move in an attempt to increase profits.  Even sitting at the bar level doesn't count toward their happy hour specials and only applies if you sit at the bar itself.  As a student, Friday's used to be one of my favorite comfort places, but it has since lost most of its personality and charm.

All these food critics aren't kidding when they say the egg salad sandwich at Euro Pane is one of the best around (it was featured on Jonathan Gold's list of things to eat in LA before you die, and also on the Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\"). It really is a seriously kick-ass sandwich.\n\nNow, listen folks. I love egg salad. A lot. In all of its many forms. But there's something about the egg salad at Euro Pane that puts it high above the rest. Most versions of egg salad that I've seen in my day are wet cement-like (albeit delicious) concoctions of diced hard boiled eggs held together with tons of mayo. The eggs in Euro Pane's salad are only medium boiled, giving the yolks a runnier consistency, and cut into larger chunks rather than diced or mashed. As a result, the integrity of the egg itself is kept in tact and you can really savor the egg flavor, rather than the mayo-heavy taste you get from most other versions. Add a squirt of lemon juice and some arugala on top of a couple of slices of sourdough and you've got one awesome sandwich.\n\nThe egg salad alone deserves 5 stars but there are some misses here. My dining partner ordered the roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich which was way too heavy on the peppers and, as a result, significantly less satisfying. Also, the oft-discussed macarons were tasty enough and came in a nice assortment of flavors, but the filling could be creamier.

The rings in question were an engagement and two wedding rings, very important.  Kerry listened to what we liked in terms of design and worked with us to fashion something unique and distinctly 'us'.  He used the idea of a mobius strip to create an interlocking engagement and wedding ring set for my sweetie and the result was elegant, organic, and truely a one of a kind.  My ring was simpler but elegant as well.  \n\nWe were so happy that he was willing to melt down old scrap gold and jewelry for us (including a few gold teeth) to form the jewelry as we wanted to minimize our impact on gold mining.

Tables can be scarce--best to figure out what you're ordering before you start standing in line, and come with a friend who can grab the table and hold it for you.  And that's about it.  I don't care  about the tables that much, but it's really really disappointing when all you want is a 1/2 and 1/2 veggie delight and egg salad sammich only to find that neither has sprouts and the sammich can't be egg salad.  Especially when you're coming from Santa Cruz.  Or Sacramento.  Or San Diego.  Then it's a bitter cup of sproutless eggsaladlessness.\n\nP.S.

Everything was the same between the two tasting menus (as we saw firsthand with the table ordering next to us), except for two supplemental courses, a cheesy pumpkin soup with grilled cheese and pork belly (rich and decadent, and maybe worth the extra cost alone), and a scoop of blackberry sorbet (lame, and a waste of a \"course\").\n\nThe dishes that overlapped in both menus ranged from good to excellent. My favorite was probably the cod cheek tempura, served with pickled peppers, preserved lemon, and a decent smattering of squid ink. There was a lot of salt in this dish, but it was not overpowering in the slightest. Seared swordfish with clams, whelks, and \"early fall succotash\" (which my friend aptly described as the vegetable portion of a tv dinner) came next. It was light and refreshing, and the sea critters were cooked perfectly.\n\nOur main entree, if you will, was a chicken thigh confit that was rather hard to dissect, both physically and flavor-wise. I wrote down the laundry list of ingredients presented by the waiter, but had trouble pinpointing some of them within the dish. I'm still drooling, however, thinking of the skin on our chicken. I may be 6'1\" and a lean 170 lbs, but I'm a fatty through and through. Now onto dessert. : )\n\nAfter my previous brunch here included sour milk panna cotta, I was a little disappointed to see it served for dinner as well. It is a delicious and texturally complex dish (the coriander casher granola is a perfect accompaniment), but I wish I got to try something different--preferably something with chocolate. For $40, I will definitely be back some Sunday in hopes of having my wish granted.", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"},

The drag, however, is the one spot off this list that I probably dread making the tour of the most.  It seems more like a memorial ground than a tourist spot to me.  \n\nWalking down that long stretch of Guadalupe, from 21st to 25th, I hardly remember what it looked like when I was a student at UT.  And I'm sure those that came and went before me have all said the same thing.  By the time I got there, Metro had taken over the old Quack's spot, a fact that my Italian professor lamented on the regular.  The Barnes and Noble, which I didn't particularly care for, but whose magazine racks I often raided for updates on the latest fashion trends or celebrity gossip is now part of the UT Co-Op complex.  Tear drops fell from my eyes when the CC's Coffee sign came down, and so went my favorite soy chai latte in town.  :(  Bye-bye, Gap, you I don't miss.  \n\nThe most notable of the fallen soldiers, however, has to be the loss of Tower Records.  It held steady for many years at the corner of 24th and Guadalupe, a bastion amongst other businesses with less Austin flare (I realize it wasn't local, but it had character).  And then it fell, yet another casualty and a sign of our changing times.  For a while it stood empty, and walking by you could still see the colorful prints on the walls that gave Tower a lot of its street cred and funk.  And I almost wondered if it would stay empty as a symbol of all that the drag has traded in exchange for more dollah dollah bills.  Intellectual Property, however, has now filled its space with books where Vinyl and CD's once stood.

There were only 3 tables left, 1 literally touching the front glass of the pastry display case, 1 blocking the kitchen exit, & a 6 top right in the thick of it.  A guy, who ended up being our waiter that night suggested the we take the one in front of the pastry counter, said it was the least molested & we took his suggestion.  I quickly ordered 2 Turkish beers, said to be like Shiner & Budweiser, of which I quickly disagreed.  They tasted more like a Killians Red (even though not red in color), & a Heineken, both good.  On the table free of cost, like chips & salsa, a sesame pita thing w/ a sesame & spice dip that is awesome!!!\n\nI was happy to see the beers come out fast & even happier when the waiter actually started taking interest in our having the best dinning experience possible.  I always ask the wait staff \"What is good?\"  I figure they are there all the time, they should know, or work somewhere else.  SIDE NOTE: (I hate it when I'm told \"Everything, or I don't have a favorite.\"  In addition, I don't like it when they say something like, I like the salad, or the burger, just because.  This tells me that they, & possibly the restaurant, has no imagination what-so-ever & is not taking pride in the food that they do have.)  The waiter promptly took the normal stance that we were American scaredy cats & that we are looking for Americanized safe food.  Oh contrar mona mi.  I have been half way around the world, food is my hobby!!!  So I proceeded to pry out of him what he likes on the menu, because frankly, I'm pretty sure he was Turkish!!!  lol.  After letting down his normal guard, he proceeded to tell us the things on the menu that he really likes & why.  Come to find out they are the things that are closest to what his mom makes him at home!!!  He suggested 4 things, paired w/ one another because each enhances the taste of the other.  We proceeded to order the full sampler because it had all 4, the suggested 4, plus 4 more!!!  If you get this sampler, be sure you have 4 people or more...lol  It comes with pickled beens, picked leeks, the yogurt sauce, egg plant salad, humus, a Turkish pico, & I forget the other 2.  I loved the pico, yogurt & humus the best  They pickle everything in Turkey I guess...lol  They give you the sesame pita like thing to dip in these samplers as well.  When it arrived the waiter was sure to explain to us all 8 of the items & bring us more pita.\n\nFor the entre we ordered the Turkish pizza which is a very thin pita w/ a \"lamb spread\" on it, then baked, but not to crunchy status.  I wondered why, but not for long because along comes the waiter again w/ instructions on how to eat the pizza.  You load it up w/ all the vegetables that were served on the side, then roll it up like a tortilla & eat it.  We were then again surprised by the waiter when he brought us a double shot glass sized glass full of what reminds me of the Indian salty lassy yogurt drink.  He tells us, take a bite of the rolled pizza, then a drink of the salty drink, & guess what?  It was perfect!!!  No better match of drink & food could be made.  Along w/ the Turkish pizza, we got a plate of lamb kabobs & rice w/ more side vegetables, pickled of course...lol  This was also good, but by this time I was stuffed, so I didn't eat as much of it.  I did however have a little of a sweet tooth after that meal though &asked what the waiter suggested.  With a Grinch like grin on his face, he told us that he had the perfect desert, but it was off menu, & $5.  Would we be interested?  Of course we were!!!  He hadn't been wrong all night!  A couple minutes later he brings out this little aluminum Turkish looking skillet, very hot, & in the middle is a couple of their \"hay stack\" looking things, smashed down into a pancake, soaked in maybe honey & butter & browned?  On top of it is a tiny scoop of heaven, otherwise known as Belgian Cream...  Of all the Mediterranean, or Turkish deserts that I have ever had, this has been the best & I would recommend it every time.  The waiter actually made it for us himself, & it is his favorite dessert that his mom makes!!! We also ordered a Turkish coffee (kinda like an espresso shot), & a Turkish hot tea (like a double shot of hot English breakfast tea).  Ladies, ask to have them tell your story from the coffee cup!!!  A perfect & wonderful ending to a perfect & wonderful meal & night.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to all those interested in good & authentic Turkish food w/ great service & a very good price.  With 4 drinks, a 4 person appetizer, 2 entres, an off the menu dessert, a Turkish coffee, & a hot Turkish tea, our bill was under $50.  Not bad for 2 full hours of eating, which only seemed like 45 minute.  Better then Fadi's!!!", "business_id": "rb0h5mLEKRiaPEpToVUjiw"},

I remember that spring day like it was yesterday. I almost jizzed my pants here that day. It's very basic, as other Pho 75 locations are. They have Pho and that's about it. No appetizers, no pork chops, nada.\n\nThe Pho here justifies the absence of other dishes though. Pho is really good most of the time. I say most of the time because, just like any other Pho places, it can be a little different day to day, and that is totally acceptable because bones and meats all don't come from the same cow. They come from happy cows, sad cows, and bikerbitch cows.\n\nGetting back to the Pho, sit down, order, and whatever you ordered will be out in front of you in less than 2 minutes. I guarantee this and am willing to bet both of Anson P.'s thumbs on this. I've been here 4 times in the past few weeks, and it's been good to great every time. Almost the same as I remember from back on that spring day in 1991. Noodles are cooked just right, meats are nice and tender and juicy, tendon is tendony, and the broth is ALWAYS piping hot. Like burn your tongue and mouth hot. The dish of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, lime, and sometimes culantro is usually fresh. Maybe being a local chain has its merits.\n\nStill one of my favorite Pho places in the DC area. Nice and dirty. I made a revelation during my meal here. I ordered a large #1 with NOTHING ELSE. No extra meat, no extra noodles. Nothing. I'm still so proud of myself that I patted myself on the back every 4 hours ever since until my update below.\n\n4.5 stars\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*** Update: How to spend $20 at Pho 75 on one bowl of Pho and free water\n\n1.

I appreciate the generous avocado spread, but the burger gets really mushy and super messy. The bread is probably what disgusts me the most. It's not firm enough and the patty slips back and forth while you eat it.\n\nThe FRENCH FRIES are good for the first 10 minutes and then they start to get soggy and limp: 2 adjectives that should never be used to describe french fries. I appreciate their effort to be \"healthy,\" but I like my fries crispy! The garlic is real garlic (none of that garlic powder), so the taste is extremely strong. Bring some mints if you plan on going back to class or to meet up with friends.\n\nMy friends often get their salads, which seem pretty big but it seems like they get the salads for the cornbread. I'm not a fan of cornbread so you won't see me with one of their plain looking salads.\n\nOverall, there are better burger places just down the street from here.

This is a great place to learn about wines - they have a very eclectic selection of wines, lots of good local ones but also wines from around the world.  The wine list alone makes this a place that should be experienced at one time or another.

I went to 3 dermatologists in the bay area that even my  friends recommended..All of 'em prescribed me different kinds of antibiotics.  It was a horrible experience.  I had huge acne all over my face up to the top of my scalp and my back.  I knew something was wrong because I was noticing that my lips were  turning black from taking oral antibiotics and topical as well.  With all these frustrations, I was so desperate and tried to go online and look for a dermatologist of  my choice.   I got to tell ya'll, I felt like it was a gamble to find one-- not knowing who would be the best one for my case.  Luckily, I found Dr. Berman.  He was intimidating at first.  Just because, he asks me first   thing, what I think was wrong with my skin.  And I'm like--well, I needed help that's why I got to see you...I mean \"i DON'T kNOW, DUH???  Then so, he checked my chest, back and tummy to see any unwanted hair growing.  And he explained to me that it could be some hormonal imbalance that I am experiencing.  So, he asked me to see an OB-gyn..And I was like--that's weird....But as desperate as I was , I thought, I'd do whatever it takes, and followed his advice.  True enough, it was some sort of abnormality...I never thought that having irregular period is REALLY a  hormonal thing.  To cut my story short,  My acne starts to diminish after like 4 months.  Now, though it sounds too good to be true, I don't see any acne in my face.  My skin color has gone better.  Dr. Berman got everything under control.  Looking back 2 years ago,   I appreciate how my skin got back to its natural glow....Not perfect yet...because I deveoped huge pores and some scaring  from acne but  Dr. Berman gave me several options for treatment .  Microdermabrasion is my favorite because it's working great minimizing my large pores.  It is a little bit expensive though but it's all worth it.   Just go and check it out .  I know!

The place is smaller than I would think from the outside probably because it is divided into two almost with an \"express\" side on one side and the sit down restaurant on the other. As we entered, you could see the beautiful modern decor with interesting lighting chandeliers and a bar area adjacent. You could also smell the seafood so if you dont like fish, you might want to go elsewhere. Most of the people that came in (mostly male on this Monday night) sat at the bar for some reason. We were the only ones sitting down at the tables. According to this website, the restaurant seats 50 people but I would say it seemed like it sat less. \n\nThe bar tender/waitress was very nice but was a little slow in anticipating what we would need (had to ask for silverware, drink refills, salt/pepper) but otherwise was very friendly. We ordered off the Harlem week prix fixe so it was cheaper than their regular menu. Appetizers on the menu were pretty tipical ~$9 or so with interesting menu choices such as calamari, lobster and shrimp roll, etc. Follow by entrees which were a little pricier as expected for seafood from $20-$50 (lobster). It is also the first time I have been asked how I would like my seafood cooked (grilled,broiled, fried and rare, medium, well). I picked a medium grilled salmon and it was yummy. It came with a very well flavored and textured mashed potatoes. My bf got grilled cod with a mixed vegetable medley. The vegetables were perfection- well seasoned, good crunch. The cod though was not good, it lacked flavor- needed a sauce or more seasoning or something but still edible. For dessert, I had the chocolate pecan pie which was delicious but I would have preferred it to be warmer. He had the chocolate cookie which I did not enjoy but the waitress was sweet and brought him milk with his cookie.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the food here but it is on a regular downtown menu price which is fine but wont be going here every day. THey also had combination platters that looked interesting that I would try when I get around to coming back (shrimp, lobster, fish, etc). Ambiance-wise, the place has nice modern decor but the crowd is typical harlem crowd I would say. Also I believe the owner is the DJ and plays good music as you dine. I enjoyed the music the entire time. One suggestion would be to have nice sauce to put atop/along side of their perfectly cooked fish to add to the flavor of the dish.\n\nP.S.

I doubt that you come here for exceptional food.\n\nGrated, their pork chops are really good.. but its the best thing on their menu. To be brutally honest, the pork chops are super tasty, and their biscuits are probably the best ive had in a long time.

I recently moved to Claremont and have been exploring my new neighborhood, and I just returned from my first trip to Pollos Kikiryki. To give a bit of background, I love food and tend to give most restaurants 4 stars. This place really disappointed me.\n\nI ordered the half rotisserie chicken and 1 side, and chose the salad as my side. The chicken was tasty, but honestly was not any better than the grocery store deli rotisserie chickens. In fact, the skin seem particularly fatty underneath, and there were several spots where the skin and meat were overcooked to a dry stringy mess. The meat did not \"fall off the bone,\" as some reviewers have said. The green sauce was also tasty, but actually rather bland, and did not compensate for the overall mediocre flavor of the chicken. The salad was literally several piece of iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato and cucumber, and what tasted like Wishbone bottled Italian dressing. I ate in the restaurant, and when I asked for tortillas, I was told that it would be 75 cents for two tortillas.\n\nThe run-down looking restaurant has zero ambience, with old plastic booths, and the food was served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. The service, while cordial enough, was not particularly friendly or enthusiastic. I'm no cheapskate, and will gladly pay good money for delicious food or a nice ambience; but for the quality of food that I got, and the rather depressing feel of the place, I did not think the experience was at all worth the $8.50 I spent there.\n\nI hate to give negative reviews, especially to small businesses, but I felt I had to add my honest 2 cents to all the oddly positive reviews listed here.

I read tons of reviews of restaurants on Yelp and decided to go here. It had pretty decent reviews and the menu that I found online looked good as well. \n\nIt went downhill from the moment we walked inside.

We waited 5 minutes before we were even addressed, even though my boyfriend and I were the only people waiting in the front. It took another 7 minutes to seat us in an almost completely empty restaurant. \n\nWe received our menus and some bread (which was good) and water. The waitress came by to announce the specials, one of which included some udon noodle dish which confused me because they do not fit the cuisine of the restaurant (Latin American-esque vs. japanese), which I thought was odd. \n\nBeing from Chicago, and having experienced real Latin American/\"American\" food, as well as actual good food, I would definitely not label this restaurant as it has been.\n\nWe ended up ordering the phyllo-wrapped lamb and the beef stew. When the food came, I couldn't help but notice how limp the \"vegetables\" were. They looked like they had been defrosted from a bag of mixed vegetables. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal were also just so-so. It had big chunks in it, like they didn't even take the time to mash them all the way. \n\nThe lamb was alright. It was cooked well, pink in the middle, but the goat cheese on the outside (between the phyllo and lamb) was overpowering. The beef stew my boyfriend had was accompanied by the same limp vegetables and half mashed potatoes. The stew itself was nothing special either. \n\nWe didn't order drinks or anything extra, and our bill was still over $45.

I went late afternoon on a Monday and was the only person in there (which i enjoyed) But i suspect they'd be busier at a more high traffic time.  My pedicure was wonderful and the massage chair didn't hurt either! There is a quiet tv playing and a vast selection of trashy magazines (double thumbs up).

Rather than venture into center city for my fix, I decided to wander around on campus at the lunch hour. I happened upon Chez Yasmine at 37th and Spruce in front of Vance Hall and was immediately excited to find tofu bahn mi on the menu, along with a number of other veg-friendly options. \n\nWoo, that was one spicy sandwich. I asked the food truck chef to go light on the spice and he obliged, but I also made the mistake of biting into one of the jalepenos. Yowza. It was delicious, overall. The spiced ground tofu, slices of cucumber and shredded carrots were nestled inside of a delightful crusty baguette. It was very nice, and I was especially excited to have a vegetarian sandwich to add to my work lunch options. I'll definitely come back and try out one of the other vegetarian options like the Gretchen quinoa salad or the Vegetarian Couscous. The owner/chef was very enthusiastic and warm.

All of their ingredients are from local farmers and their seasonal menu changes several times to reflect seasonal ingredients.  \n\nA magnet for celebrities (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Bill and Hill), HT is not glitzy or hip, but relazed, homey, kind of rustic with muted sophistication.  \n\nEverything on the menu is fantastic.  I always go with the crab cakes or an omelet.  French toast is amazing too!  Seasonal breads are baked fresh and will leave you craving more.  \n\nOne thing to note is that Henrietta's Table is very active with the Farm School - a farm in western mass. that has an apprenticeship program for area children.  How cool is that?  At your table, you will also find Farmer Cards that tell you about the farm and farmer who raised the vegetables on the menu.  Charming and fantastic!!  The front of the restaurant also has a mini retail section where you can purchase spices, kitchen gadgets and various condiments and snacks.  I've bought several \"Henrietta\" stuffed pigs as gifts.  \n\nI absolutely recommend HT for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner.  You will not be disappointed.

We walk in and are told that we need to wait for a table. So we're patiently waiting, and then we notice a woman bitching out the staff there, because she noticed that there were many open tables, but she was still being told to sit and wait like we were. I later realize that they're not seating us not because there aren't available tables, but because they were short on staff and they couldn't handle having more tables occupied by patrons. Anyway, we finally sit, I order a beer and my girlfriend orders a mango margarita. After a long time of waiting for our drinks, the waiter comes back and asks us what we ordered again. We tell him, and he apologizes and says it's because apparently he's like the only waiter working the whole restaurant that night or something. Anyway, we get our drinks, and my girlfriend's is a white color...definitely not mango. We tell them this and they come out with the proper mango margarita and tell us that the other one is free...so my girlfriend is sitting there with 2 huge margaritas in front of her. So then we order our food and it is decent, we're eating...and all of a sudden a busser walks by, heading to the kitchen holding a tray of dirty dishes. However, he doesn't realize that the tray had a spilled Coke on it, so basically as he was walking by he was splashing Coke on the people in my row, including my girlfriend. Not only that, upon realizing that he is splashing people with Coke, he doesn't even apologize, but instead just places extra napkins on each table for us to wipe ourselves off with. Are you kidding me?? A guy sitting on another table alerts the manager about the Coke splashed on him and the manager tells him his entree is free. I decide to call him over and speak my mind too, and so my girlfriend gets her entree free as well. Later, as we are about to leave, a guy who just started eating in a table next to us says in horror: \"Oh my God, my chicken is raw!\" At this point we decide to escape this nightmarish experience and go home. This place would normally get 1 star, but I decided to be nice and bump it up because we did end up getting a free drink and meal that night, and I'm cheap like that.", "business_id": "HdGDvsK8jEdstSS5g21FDg"},

This is the only place I've ever been to which offers a UCLA discount with an ID card where every single person has to show their card. The server insisted that EACH INDIVIDUAL PRESENT A CARD. What the fuck? We're two ASIANS IN WESTWOOD. It doesn't get more UCLA than that? Why do we need to present a card for each individual? Have you had too many issues in your few months of existence with those Sneaky UCLA kids pawnin' their cards off to one another? So..... If we're a group of 4 Individuals eatin at your restaurant all 4 of us need to present our card? I didn't know that Panini Cafe turned into UCLA Powell Library at night? Who knew? At least if didn't show my card here I wouldn't get tased.....  I think it's in poor taste that for a family of two UCLA Bruins you couldn't just use one card. The mere fact that you made my Sister walk like 15 mins in her 4 inch heels just so she could get her card? 20% is a huuuuge price difference? It's just silly. This kinda overally put a damper mood at my experience here. I gave it a 2 star ratin' because in all honesty yes Overall.... It's not bad. If you're a UCLA student and have a card use it.

We sent a few emails back and forth about what we were looking for, and when we came in, he pulled out a tray of about 15 diamonds covering a broad spectrum of quality. He unwrapped about 5 at a time, telling us what the differences were, demonstrating how to use the magnifier to find the flaws in each diamond, and taking us outside to show how they look in natural light. As we slowly eliminated diamonds that were outside our desired parameters, he took them away and replaced them with new ones, until we found one that was perfect for us. We wouldn't have picked this stone before coming in, but Neil's demonstrations helped us discover what qualities were important to us, and we are extremely happy with our decision.\n\nThe best part about this process is that we never felt rushed at any point during the 4 hours we were there. Neil made this explicitly clear to us, and each time he was done answering our questions, he popped out to the back so we could have a private conversation about what we thought of the diamonds. We also felt like he had more stones to pull out if we were dissatisfied about any aspect, and in the end, we picked our diamond because we were sure we would not ever be able to find a better one.\n\nThe prices here are amazing - comparable to Blue Nile or Costco, but with the immeasurable benefit of having an actual jeweler. Neil's post-purchase policy was another major factor in our decision - any regular maintenance on the ring would be covered for life. He also offers upgrades on rings, although he charges a restocking fee on the diamond, which he explained is a precaution against future fluctuations in diamond prices.", "business_id": "IBz37nHTguMVvSfLQHeZZA"},

One can seat about 6 or 7 people, the other can seat four. The other three can seat two. That's 17 people. There are also about 10 stools at the bar. So if you come in with a group and the big table is taken, you're pretty much going to be looking for another place to eat. This place is TINY.\n\nI'd actually call it almost a romantic dinner type of place if it didn't smell so awful (sorry I'll stop complaining now). But one more thing, our wet, greasy waiter also smelled like he just came off the fisherman's boat. Was he the cook AND the waiter? Possibly.\n\nOn the plus side, he was very jolly and attentive. Super nice, besides him almost not letting us eat because there were four of us with the POSSIBILITY of a fifth person, and the big table was already taken.\n\nSo while I was there, I got a bento box. Steak skewers, noodles, slaw and edamame. The steak skewers tasted a little funky, like they were cooked along with the fish. So I only ate a few bites of those. The noodles were not good. The edamame was very undersalted (if you want good Edamame, go to Ebisu!), and I'd have to say the best part of the bento box was the coleslaw. For 15 bucks.\n\nThe portions for anything else were TINY. My friend got the shrimp plate and got, I think, four or five shrimp. I think it was 8 bucks or so.\n\nThe one redeeming quality of this place is that they have crushed ice, which generally excites me.\n\nI won't ever come back here.

They have a habit of taking their sweet time boxing up the cupcakes before finishing up your order. They accidentally gave my order to another person and totally forgot about my order. I brought it up with the cashier and she quickly checked the tickets and said I was next. Nothing else. Next was 10 minutes later after I asked again. I was charged for my free cupcake and I had to go back to get it remedied. The cupcakes were well packaged, I'll give it that.\n\nThe cupcakes were lovely little things though. The taste? The frosting is decent but all sugar - cut it with plenty of milk. The cakes didn't really have a chocolate flavor but had a good moist texture though. Hype is what keeps this place in business.

It's huge, so they were able to get me an appointment at the last minute.  Up until this point, I would never have gotten a haircut without getting lots of reviews on the person first.  However, I was desperate, so it's just luck that I ended up with someone so amazing!\n\nMy husband and I loyally go to SHARA for haircuts.  She's amazing!!!  I also get the keratin hair treatment every few months.  I switched to Shara at Beautique, and I haven't looked back to my old salon, an adorable little place in Montrose.  Shara is great at styling, and I've even tried adding color.  Basically, she's awesome!\n\nI used to go to RAZA for bikini waxes.  She made what could be an awkward and uncomfortable situation quick and painless.  I loved her!  The only reason I don't still go to her is because I found a place that is a little less expensive.  I still haven't found anyone who has nearly as much talent at Raza though!\n\nI go to MARCIA for facials and she is so amazing!  I'm trying to balance my dermatologist's medicines with her treatment.  My dermatologist dries out my skin, and yes, I know that's his point.

I go to her every month and I love her!\n\nBeautique is huge, which can be good and bad.  On the bright side, you can usually get an appointment.  I also love that you can get so many services all at one location.  On the down side, because it's huge, you don't have that charming spa-like atmosphere.

I had wanted to update my skills, network, and learn more about parts of the industry I am not experienced in. I'd meant to do it for years, but never found time to enroll. I finally enrolled and started classes at the end of 2009 and worked straight through - which I definitely recommend if your schedule and funds permit.\n\nAt its best, the program is educational (though rarely challenging) and facilitates unmatched networking opportunities with students, instructors, and guest lecturers. Different courses touch on many aspects of the industry and the experience is as diverse as the students and instructors in the program. That said, the majority of students, instructors, and classes are based in the Public Works market. If you have a lot of Public Works experience, the program will feel very basic at times. If you're not experienced in Public Work, you're going to learn a lot.\n\nI have to give my highest regards to one instructor, Sean Leonard. He and a handful of others, including Albert Giocamazzi [sp], are tremendously gifted, passionate about their industry, and gracious enough to share their experience and time with students.\n\n At its worst, the program has classes geared towards people with no practical experience in the industry or led by professors who don't have time to fully prepare - in such cases I found myself fighting to stay awake or even show up. The courses are not challenging (except for the law class) unless you want them to be. My best experience in terms of learning new skills came with the online courses taught by Ataa Aly. I studied Revit and MS Project with him. Those classes were great; straight-forward skill building with excellent exercises.\n\nI feel like the program itself is set so students can get what they want out of it. Many people show up every class and actively contribute to the experience, just as many, however, are there because they have to be and act like high school delinquents when they bother showing up at all. Your experience and the value of the program really comes from your fellow students. There were too many classes where the same 2-3 people would participate and the remainder would sit silent. Those classes were the hardest to sit through.\n\nAll in all, I would certainly recommend the program. Still, classes are expensive, starting around $525 for a basic course and going to $750 for courses with computer labs. I think UCLA X should really take a look at their fee schedule. Having completed the course, I feel like the courses were worth maybe $350 - $400 each, nothing near the prices they charge. So if you're not able to blow through the program in one year, definitely take your time. Nothing you learn is going to catapult you to the next level professionally.", "business_id": "3k9PWkWl7WYLySeudeGx6w"},

I bought a few small packets of essential spices and made a note to come back whenever I wanted to make an interesting recipie where i needed just a bit of spices. Side note: the spices i did buy nothing came out to over a dollar. Granted i bought small amounts i highly doubt i will go through them with any great speed. The spices alone get this place a solid 3 stars. Over priced spices is a pet peeve of mine what can i say. \n\nThe grains were exciting as well but not as much for me as im not a huge baker.

I tried coming back for the bubble tea since my roommate constantly raves about it along with most of her friends. I tried the red bean bubble tea, but it tasted a bit chalky which seemed to be due to using a powder and not mixing very well. Finally, the last time I was here was due to my roommate dragging me here (ok, maybe not literal dragging...but I always make her go to Oasis, so it was my turn to go to her favorite bubble tea place; though, I did not go happily!). I got the strawberry milk tea, which is my regular drink at Oasis and what I usually get to compare bubble tea places. Wow, this was the worst tasting bubble tea I've ever had in my life. It tasted like strawberry flavored medicine, to be exact it tastes like these nasty strawberry chewable zinc vitamins by Zicam. Since I had paid almost $4 for it (including the credit card fee), I tried to force myself to drink it....however, it was so bad I just wanted to throw up every time I took a sip. I can't remember what my roommate got, but it tasted like sprite and was really overkill on the sweetness.

They all usually end up being very similar on 1 fact: the food tastes dulled down. What I mean by that is they cater to a non-Indian crowd, and while the dishes are still tasty they lack that extra zing and kick that comes from an overload of spice. \n\nMaharaja seems more authentic, they are not scared to spice up a dish, to add that little extra spice that gives it an edge versus the other indian restaurants in the city. Now, when I say this I'm not referring to how spicy the food is, I'm referring to the spice flavoring.\n\nI started with the paneer pakora, and they were very good. Not amazing, pretty standard for an Indian place, but you can only do so much with pakora. The paneer was very tasty and they were fried without dripping with oil. \n\nNext, I had the paneer makhani. The paneer was excellent, and the makhani sauce was made just right. Enough spice with a hint of cream, and that fresh tomato zing at the end. Yum!\n\nI finished with the Kulfi Falooda, which was a bit misleading. The Kulfi part was AMAZING. I have had tons of kulfi, in the US and India, and this was spot on. The taste was rich, and the icyness still present.  I was a bit mislead by the falooda. The falooda dish is one of my favorites, and there is a very specif way to make it. One of the ingredients is this white spaghetti of sorts that's mixed into rose milk. The dish we ordered had the bed of spaghetti over which the kulfi was served. I wouldn't call that falooda, and the noodles detracted from the taste of the kulfi. Honestly, if they just cut out the noodles and served an extra piece of kulfi, I would be in heaven.\n\nBesides the food, the restaurant is very classy, located on the 2nd floor of a building, across the hall from Shabu-Ya.

I told her I had written the address I was changing my licence to, and she instructed me to write my currently-registered address, which I did.  A minute after she sent me away, she called me back saying that I gave her the wrong address... Um, right..

While some reviewers have complained that the teas take longer to make, that's only because of the care needed to freshly brew certain varieties of tea - if you're in a hurry, just ask which drinks are made faster.

Individual cupcake reviews (I've tried most -of them!) follow.  Note that these are based on my personal tastes (chocolate is better than vanilla, the darker the better, and buttercream frosting is better than cream cheese frosting):  \n\n***Dark Chocolate***: I know it's too rich for some people, but if you love dark chocolate this cupcake is to die for.   Moist dark chocolate cake and rich, bittersweet buttercream frosting.   They use the finest quality chocolate and you can tell.  This is my #1 cupcake of all time, here or anywhere else.\n***Mocha***: A close second to the dark chocolate, this has the same cake as the dark chocolate and a very similar frosting, but it has a mocha flavor as well.  It is powerful but not overwhelming and is really, really excellent as well.\n***Banana***: Another cupcake they do very well.  It is available with vanilla or dark chocolate frosting, and sometimes milk chocolate frosting (off-the-menu).   I obviously prefer it with dark chocolate, but my bf loves the vanilla (it is his favorite Sprinkles cupcake in fact).  The cake is moist and has a nice banana flavor without being too strong.   \n***Milk Chocolate***: These cupcakes have milk chocolate frosting, and either a vanilla cake part (Vanilla Milk Chocolate) or a dark chocolate cake base (Milk Chocolate).  Obviously, I prefer dark over milk chocolate but I think the frosting is still pretty good, although it is cream cheese-based, rather than butter-based, and thus has a different taste.  I also think the dark chocolate cake is moister than the vanilla cake.   \n***Vanilla***: This is vanilla cake with vanilla frosting.   I found this boring and bland (and also think their vanilla cake is too dry).\n***Red Velvet***: Probably their most popular, but I think it is over-hyped.  I am not a huge fan of red velvet cupcakes in general, but I don't like these.  The frosting is ok (considering I'm not a cream cheese frosting person and I like it pretty well, it must be pretty good), but I find the cake part way too oily.   Also the red food coloring they use bleeds all over your hands when you're eating it.\n***Strawberry***: This one is WAY too sweet.   I like strawberries fairly well, but this cupcake just has an incredibly overpowering sweetness that makes it hard to eat.  \n***Cinnamon Sugar***: This \"cupcake\" has no frosting and tastes basically like a muffin.   It is a fairly bland muffin at that (no fruit, no chocolate, etc) and is pretty dry.  It was edible, but not better than a typical grocery store muffin and certainly not worth $3.25\n***Chai Latte***: The cardamom is overpowering.  I like chai tea, but I didn't like this cupcake at all.  Half of it went in the trash.\n***Peanut Butter Chip***: I like the cake part, which has a very mild peanut butter flavor and chocolate chips throughout (even better when slightly melted) and the frosting has a strong peanut flavor, but you get the chocolate flavor from the chocolate sprinkles.  Pretty good.\n***Orange***: I don't eat oranges, but my boyfriend liked it alright.  No raves though.\n***Pumpkin***: Nice, lightly spiced pumpkin cake and cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  The frosting is not my favorite (cream cheese) and is a little too sweet, but its balanced by the pumpkin cupcake.   This is one of my favorite non-chocolate cupcakes.\n***Key Lime*** (seasonal):  I don't like key lime flavor.  My boyfriend liked it reasonably well, but didn't give it any raves.\n***Lemon Blueberry*** (seasonal): We didn't hate it, but given how much we both like blueberries, this cupcake is not the best.\n***Summer Cherry*** (seasonal): I didn't try (I hate cherries) but my boyfriend was not a fan at all, and said this might be the worst Sprinkles cupcake he tried.\n***Raspberry*** (seasonal):  I really hated it, but my boyfriend loved it, so I guess it depends on your raspberry threshold (it is VERY raspberry-ey and also verrryyyy sweet...I thought it tasted like cough medicine).\n***Almond Dark Chocolate***(seasonal): Dark chocolate frosting that I love, of course, but the almond cake is terrible.  I like almonds fairly well, and I don't mind the nuts in the cake even though they are a little soggy.  But they used about 10 times too much almond extract and so the cake has an incredibly overpowering, artificial flavor (and smell!)\n***Flourless Chcolate***(seasonal) They only have this the week of Passover, but it is outstanding.   It tastes much more like a brownie than a normal cupcake and comes with a vanilla glaze instead of frosting, but its really really good.    \n\nI don't recommend the \"minis\" that they've introduced now.  Its a tempting idea - cheaper & a smaller portion size, but they're SO small (one bite, basically) that its hardly worth $2.   They're also a bit drier than the regulars and the frosting is plopped on  & not spread out. \n\n(Best ___: Best Cupcake)", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"},

While Eddie's, as occupied by its latter proprietors, had indecipherable Soviet Post Office Hours, Ginger is pretty much open from a more convenient FiddlerRoofian Sunrise to Sunset, to accomodate ideal rumpus hours across the street at Grant Park. \n\nMy picnic date and I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich ($7) with arugula, red onion marmalade, and horseradish aioli. The horseradish was mild, and good for those whose palate and disposition are not \"as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard,\" but the sandwich was still very flavorful, as was the marinated veggie with goat cheese sandwich ($6). As side salads, we got the Greek (picnic date thought there was too much raw amino acid sulfoxide-laden onion) and the potato salad (very classic and simple, but good...not too much mayo, but still soft potatoes for the win!). I came back the next day and ordered a cafe mocha, which is made with our native Pasadena delicious Jone's coffee. The owner was so excited about the new shipment of chocolate, and thus my mocha was truly Oompa-loompaesque. (He asked if he put too much chocolate, which is unfortunately a question based on an impossible premise, and I will soon vigorously recommend that he read \"Plato and Platypus Walk Into a Bar.\") I do have perhaps one gripe with the otherwise delicious cafe mocha; in my opinion it wasn't quite warm enough, so increasing the brew temp would be my only suggestion. We partook of the free samples of desserts (a savory cookie with lots of herbs and spices and a flaky pastry with chocolate), and both were delicious.  \n\nThe store is very cute and has old fashioned Hershey bars, soda pop bottles, and various other Ye-Olde-Confectionary-Shoppe style items. They also have a few toys for the kiddos. These are cool, but I do recommend supplying larger and heavier hula hoops, for all but the tiniest of children. This is because (according to a powerpoint I just found on the internet), it's easier to keep the hula going that way: \"The heavy hoop has more rotational energy, so it will be easier to keep moving. The faster the hoop goes!, the more centripetal force...which pushes it up against my body! The more normal force it feels from my body, the more static friction is keeping it from sliding down.\" Basically, what happened was that I told my picnic date I was a world-class hula hooper, and this ended in a major embarrassment. \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend heading to Ginger and having a nice picnic, while ogling at cute basketball players in the courts across the street. The food is good and reasonably priced, and the whole family is very friendly and excited for people to like their food.", "business_id": "viYnDqIlZ4mJyD8GunTwrQ"},

Here's why: when I got my taco's they were \"black bean and bacon\" and a \"migas\" taco.  First the black bean taco was boiled black beans (not refried) with no spices loaded on a soggy doughy tortilla with a 1 scant piece of nearly burnt crumbled bacon on top.  The Migas taco was half soggy tortilla chips cooked into eggs with soupy tomatoes and onions, again no flavor.  I think the one spice was paprika for color.  The tomato and onion in the Migas taco seamed pre-cooked as the onion was thin and translucent like from soup and the entire taco tasted like a bland canned stewed tomato + corn chips.\n\nNow, I could understand getting some thrown together food if Arturos was a hotel and food was something the just did on the side.  BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT OUT BAD FOOD WHEN THIS IS ALL YOU DO!  If i seam upset it is because I am.  I grew up in restaurants and worked in them for many years later and I know it isn't hard to make decent food so when I blow $11 on bland tacos and a rare opportunity for a weekday breakfast with my girlfriend its a real let down.  \n\nAurturos here some advice on how to improve your food that is cost effective:\n\nBeans: Since you are making it in large batches, to start roughly and quickly chop equal amount of onion and tomato and toss it in with your beans that you let soak overnight.  Then half that amount of seeded jalape\u00f1os and garlic, then half that amount of a spice blend of equal parts cumin and salt and one cheap beer and one handful of cilantro for every onion you put in.  Bam! Beans with flavor. \n\nBacon, get a big oven tray, lay out thick-cut pieces and stick them in the oven.  This lets them stay plump, cook all the way and get browned without getting small hard and crumbly.  This will also save you tons of labor as you can set a timer and just have one person pop them in and out between doing other work.  If you want to make refried bean (which is the only thing you should be putting on tacos) take the bacon drippings and add them to some beans and blend.  Nothing wasted.\n\nMigas:  NEVER PRECOOK YOUR VEGGIES, prep a mix of seeded and chopped jalape\u00f1os (yes you can get a seeding tool at restaurant supply that lets you do this fast [$5] so no excuses) chopped onion, chopped cilantro, sliced mushroom.  Get THIN TORTILLA CHIPs like Milagros, they don't get soggy and ON HIGH HEAT put them in the oil first, hit the chips with a season blend of equal parts: salt, garlic powder, cumin, paprika.  Then a hand full your veggie mix,  brown edges of veggies, then add egg and done.  \n\nAnyone still reading this now knows this isn't hard and thus understands why it is so lame to get bland goofed up tacos.  Get it together Arturo's and if you wanna send me my $11 back reply to this review and I'll forward you my address.  Its the least you could do for the free cooking advice and bummer breakfast.", "business_id": "eZE0FdYB9rUvbuPS4fNyYA"},

I've ate a lot of pretty nice places, but the food here was so good.  The chef certainly does seem a little nutty, but it was completely worth it.  We were lucky in that we went on a Wednesday night at 6PM and there was no one else there.  We were the only party there from 6PM-8PM, which I always find somewhat awkward but it certainly made the food arrive faster.\n\nAfter we ordered, we were brought a cold pasta dish complements of the chef.  This is the way pasta is supposed to be served!  It was by far the tastiest pasta I have ever had.  It was incredible.  INCREDIBLE!  We also ordered a calamari and sugar pea appetizer, that was amazing.  I tried recreating the dish at home, and while it came out well, their version was a lot better.  For my entree I had the duck with some sort of sweet dressing on it.  It was the most perfect cooked duck I have ever had, and the infusion of Asian flavors into the meal was fantastic.\n\n5 stars for the food, but there was so much of it and I wanted to take some of the duck home.  We asked for a box and were told that they did not have boxes.  My food was wrapped in saran wrap and put into a paper bag.  I'm sure this has something to do with the chef's eccentricity, but it put me off a tiny bit.  Regardless I want to go back again as soon as possible!", "business_id": "biNk2izKRsujpMUT-0WKLg"},

We previewed the prix fix menu and thought the offering sounded the best out of any of the local spots that were participating. We even checked the rating on Yelp and came to the conclusion that it would be a good bet we would be treated to an excellent dining experience. With the exception of the dessert (she had the bread pudding and I had the cheesecake) we were severely underwhelmed. We also couldn't get reservations until 9pm. When we got there, the only full tables were the patio seats. Pretty much the whole inside dining room was empty, leading us to believe they had a certain amount of tables set aside for guests of the hotel. Had we been able to get reservations earlier, our experience might have been different.\n\nLet's start with the apps. My greens and smoked salmon was a decent but not fantastic opener. She had the crabcake which was definitely better. The crabcake had enough fresh cooked crabmeat to make it different than the traditional offering, but also had enough flavor to be noteworthy. Smoked salmon is still smoked salmon, even when you add what is supposed to be a bacon seasoning which I didn't taste at all. I guess I was expecting naively that I would be getting something a little more inspired based on the menu description. \n\nFrom there the meal took a severe nose dive. I ordered the lamb shank in a port wine reduction with a side of roasted potatoes. Roasted potatoes are hard to mess up, but HT did. I was given a generous helping of dry and under-seasoned things. The lamb was so drenched in the port wine sauce that it could have been roast pork I was eating and I would not have known the difference. Lamb is one of the more flavorful meats but when you drench it in a sauce that would overpower the flavor of calves liver, you know you have gone down the wrong culinary path. My girlfriend's salmon was dry but tasted decent enough. The flavor wasn't abundant but it was there.\n\nWe finished off with the chocolate bread pudding and the amaretto cheesecake. These desserts were both great and by the second bite, I was thinking that we had just bought $33 desserts. The bread pudding as rich as it was still packed a whole lot of chocolate and banana flavor that would have been finished to the last bite had we been enjoying ourselves more. I really liked the cheesecake as it wasn't too heavy but was creamy and tasty. -I was searching for the amaretto flavor, but decided it was amaretto by default by the top coating of thinly sliced roasted almonds.\n\nOur drinks were also a factor in the rating. I ordered a spicy margarita. Spicy, no. Margarita, maybe. It ended up being a watered down version of a margarita with a hint of tequila and no evidence that the bartender gave consideration to the drink menu. Her mead manhattan sounded good in theory, but really just tasted like a weakened sangria-tini. Oh well, might as well try something new once in a while right? \n\nHenrietta's Table should be fantastic, but if it is we missed it that night (a Tuesday).  Apparently brunch is the recommended time to go, so maybe we went at the wrong time. For the price and the reputation, we expected much more.", "business_id": "1iY5q6spBS_DNWyemY829A"},

As it was my first time at this dental practice, I didn't think much of this question and I told her \"no thanks.\" However, throughout the rest of the examination and cleaning she made me feel incredibly self-conscience by repeatedly asking me if I \"wanted to get it fixed,\" and commenting \"I could fix that.\"  This happened at least 5 times, including times while I couldn't even respond while she was working inside my mouth.\n\nTo be clear: In all my 30+ years I have NEVER run into anyone ever commenting or pressuring me to \"fix the gap in my teeth.\" \n\nFor a professional dentist, she was completely unprofessional, clearly lacks social tact, and apparently does not listen to her clients.\n\nThe is the first time in 30+ years that I have ever decided to not return to a dental practice.", "business_id": "OgvbKQVIa9roTwN6rDP9yA"},

The large latte is actually the size of a Starbucks grande, but it costs near the amount of a tall; however, it manages to safely combine FOUR shots of espresso into the cup. FOUR. The espresso junkie in me is jumping for joy right now. The espresso has a mildly sweet taste to it, and the ratio of espresso to flavored syrup to milk is done very well, as to compliment the great taste of these four shots without taking away from the authenticity of a latte. While this latte was surprisingly delicious to me, I still think Taste Coffee House beats it out by a smidgen, especially when considering the barista skills of the Taste guys... the latte art and overall taste couldn't quite compare.

This is such a great place filled with love, compassion and friendliness.  They have an event going on almost every night and most of the time, they are open to newcomers.  Their regular mass in the main church is very traditional and beautiful.  The organist and choir are amazing.  For the more modern folk, they have a mass called Mosaic every Sunday at 11 am in their smaller chapel, St. Bedes.  This is my mass of choice - it is complete with less archaic sermons and contemporary music with live performers.  They boast to 'come as you are' and they mean it.  Everyone is so welcoming and even if this faith is new to you, they are there for you.  There is a projection screen with the readings and songs displayed, so you are never lost.  The priests are always available for counsel after mass and they even have a prayer group present on a weekly basis accepting requests.  Every Wednesday, they have the 'great dinner' and it is all volunteers working, as is the case many of the events.  I've worked this many times - it is such a great experience filled with satisfaction and laughter.  The decor is beyond amazing and the flowers are always beautiful.  The campus is huge and they even have a place for kids to learn and a playground.  If you are new to the city and looking for a welcoming place to express yourself, learn about the faith, volunteer, pray or just meet people, Palmer is definitely the place to go for people of all ages.", "business_id": "_tTTuyGAyIcm3mYonSnxjA"},

I had to ask him who he was. He looked at some discs I had brought for a couple of minutes, then asked me to walk on my heels, walk on my toes, step onto a ledge. He asked what caused (preceded the onset of) my pain and where it was. Then he proceeded to tell me that there was nothing he could do for me. I asked \"But why did they do surgery before?\" (three surgeries for stenosis, on all three levels of spine, two done at Stanford). His answer \"I know nothing about that\" (though he had all my records in front of him). Then I asked him how small my spinal cord had to be before surgery would be done (it is \"severely stenotic\" in several places on MRI, e.g. 5 mm across, and I am essentially unable to stand or walk). He said \"No one will do anything until no 'white area' [spinal cord viewed on MRI] is visible at all. We only operate when the disk is gone and bone rubs on bone.\" (This is not my problem.) He repeated this information, about disks and bone-on-bone, slowly and with exaggerated patience. He told me that what I had, severe stenosis, was a \"just part of aging, like wrinkles.\" Then he mentioned \"You probably have a fracture.\" I asked him what I could do about that and he said \"That's not my problem, is it?\" (Numerous studies and practitioners have viewed my spine in the last two years, and I've heard nothing about a fracture.) At about this point, he picked up his dictation device and, as if to tell us it was over, began dictating in our presence. I listened as long as I could (he misrepresented what I had said, saying I'd sought a diagnosis from \"several doctors,\" which is not true - only one other local neurosurgeon, who suggested I come to Stanford). That was my visit, aside from being sent to X-ray to confirm the fracture. I was left thinking that: every doctor I'd seen (the neurologist who'd done my EMG and told me that \"this will get you surgery,\" the radiologists who'd read my MRIs and X-rays, my primary who referred me to Stanford Neurosurgery, my rheumatologist, and the one other neurosurgeon I'd consulted), were all crazy or incompetent. Plus I would be stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, with severe back and buttock pain, unable to stand. Needless to say, I was devastated.

We were rowdy and the conversation was not exactly on the conservative side.  Our main waitress was especially helpful in taking special requests.  One of our friends wanted something \"different,\" so the waitress checked in with the cook and he whipped up some sausage he was working on for the following week's menu.  The waitress was willing to exchange the same friend's drink for something else free of charge because our friend \"didn't like it.\"  And even towards the end of the night when they were starting to clean up, the staff wasn't pushy in trying to get us to leave.\n\n2. The meal.  The best damn snap peas I've ever had, and decent roast chicken to boot.  \n\n3. The drinks.  I noticed that the beer & wine menu was quite varied.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The portion sizes.

While the staff themselves were great, it took a while for anyone to take our drink, appetizer and entree orders.  I was a hungry, hungry hippo and they probably didn't bring out the bread till 20 minutes after we got there.  \n\n3. The taste.  While my meal was more than decent, my girlfriend's gnocchi tasted super-artificial.  And my friend's sausage tasted like I could have gotten it at a grocery store.  Which, for the price, shouldn't be the case.\n\n4. The menu.  It was too specialized for my taste.  While they were great about accommodating special dietary needs and substitutions, I had a difficult time finding something I actually liked.  \n\nWe were told that their menu changes weekly, so don't necessarily depend on what you see on the online menu (this per the waitress).

I brought it up that I could -and was willing-to give her the fluids at home-as I had been given that option for another one of my cats from our regular vet.  My experience has been that  VCA always recommends as many tests as they can-where other vets start with basic blood panel and go from there.

I was so excited that a shabu place was coming to Harvard. But the fare was so awful that we actually left about three bites into the meal, and I have never done that before. I've eaten shabu many times, most often at spots in Chinatown or Allston/Brighton, so this review is not out of ignorance.\n\nSushi: the salmon sashimi was cut wrong and from the wrong part of the fish. It was mushy, floppy, and had too much of that gray fatty skin on it. \n\nShabu: The meat was awful (chicken dryer and beef way way tougher/chewier than at other shabu spots). The broth was NOT broth, but plain old fatty chicken stock. This gave the veggies and meats a bad flavor. The dab of soy sauce/tsuru was way too salty - it should have been much less salty and served more liberally.  \n\nService: They clearly don't have their game down. The meal came out in fragments - the meat came out about 10 minutes before the veggies, and the \"broth\" had been boiling away for some time when we finally got to start cooking. They gave us a single \"broth\" pot, rather than one with a divider. We asked to switch, and they did so right away. There were more servers than customers, and yet service was still slow, and a bit clumsy. \n\nLayout: The tables don't seem quite big enough for shabu. There were just 2 of us at a table for 4, but the food was cramped and took up the whole table, so we were reaching across the boiling pot and hotplate to reach the meat and veggies. Not sure how it would fit 4 people. \n\nManagement: They were very concerned when we asked for the check, and asked lots of questions. We certainly appreciated the concern, and they actually didn't let us pay though we wanted to. After hearing what we thought was wrong with the meal, they explained it by saying that \"they serve Chinese shabu, this is Thai shabu.\" But given that shabu is Japanese, we weren't really convinced. \n\nGoodness, I hope they get it together. I will be dropping cash here once they do**.\n---\n**Update: I will now be dropping cash at Shabu Ya, the other new shabu shabu joint that just opened up in Harvard Square.

When she moved away and I eventually moved as well, I haven't been able to really find that \"perfect match\"\n\nI went to Amyrose at Peter Thomas whose haircut I loved about 1.5months ago but it was time for that post-highlights trim to remove all the dead ends. I made the mistake of stopping at Maxi Hair on the way home \"just to get a trim.\" \n\nNEVER again.\n\nHannah cut my hair and while it seems that other people on here absolutely loved her cuts, it seems like she has no idea how to cut shorter hair. I have been trying to grow out my hair for a few months and I specifically requested three things:\n\n1) Keep as much length as possible-- i.e. just remove the split ends\n2) I do not like blunt cuts so keep the A-line shape that I already have with a VERY minimal trim. I have a wider, square face and I tend to look like a block on a stick (my neck) when I get blunt cuts. REALLY unflattering.\n3) DON'T touch my bangs because I decided I wanted to grow them back out.\n\nWhat did Hannah do? Take off over 2\" of length all around to give me a blocky, old lady blunt cut and she CUT MY BANGS before I had a chance to even respond. By the time I was able to yell \"stop\" the first chunk had already been shortened and it was too late to fix it. At that point she was like \"oops I already cut them\" and I had to let her even them out unless I wanted to go home with one section of bangs that was obviously shorter than the rest.\n\nWhile the layers and the rest of the cut was fine, it was clear that the comprehension wasn't there-- what about \"don't touch the bangs and don't give me a blunt cut\" is so hard for a stylist to understand?!\n\nJust to add insult to injury, after being told on the phone that there was a student discount of $5 for a haircut, I was told in person at the cash register that they don't honor student discounts for a haircut with Hannah! I also was told over the phone that blow dry is an extra $5 but I ended up being charged $10 at the counter.\n\nIn addition, after I was steaming about the lack of listening, the other lady at the counter had the nerve to ask me if I needed an eyebrow wax (while giving me the look that implies that she thinks I needed one) and if I was ever planning on fixing my roots.\n\nThat being said, if you've had your hair cut here before and you know and trust someone here, kudos to you, but as for me, I'll pay the extra $5-10 to go somewhere else. Yes, a $35 haircut is pretty moderately priced, but it's $35 too much for my current haircut. I wish I could reverse time a full 2 hours.", "business_id": "4lPpcPrYGS-jrOhJSTFu7A"},

I had eyed Rangzen on my visits to the Cambridge Public Library, and have been very curious what Tibetan food would be like ever since. They seated us after just 5 minutes. Win!\n\nWell, this particular Tibetan food was... OK. Just OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. For starters, we shared two types of bread. One was plain with just a little butter, and the other, superior, looked more like a wrap - vegetables baked into the crepe-like outside and wrapped around other veggies. As for my entree, I got a beef entree. It was shreded beef and mushrooms over bean noodles with tomatoes and potatoes and garlic. My biggest complaint is that the sauce was just very very thin - it was like an oily/watery tomato sauce. The very thin, small noodles got lost in the mix. I tried my boyfriend's chicken steamed dumplings, and these were alright, but they were very basic, and didn't go that well with the sauce they came with. \n\nSo yeah, that's nice that this restaurant is not too busy for walk-ins on 8:30 on a weekend night, but then again, I may not be going down this side street again except to pick up the latest best sellers.\n\nPS: The other couple I dined with got 2 cups of Poecha tea, the traditional butter tea of the region.

Hollanders blew me away with their selection, quality and service. \n\nI just went over there for the first time during Ann Arbor's Midnight Madness.  This was my first trip there and I spent so much time there I think I was in there for 45 minutes to an hour. In a paper store?- seriously I was. \n\nSUMPTUOUS PAPER\nYou just want to reach out and touch, rub, feel the papers, as some of them look silky and alive (but I kept my hands off so as to not ruin the papers).  It's an explosion of design for the senses.  Some of their paper looks like you could take it off the rack and begin sewing with it, it's that beautiful. \n\nTIP OF THE CARDSTOCK\nPaper is just one item at Hollanders though, as they have many gifts, stationaries, cards, journals, etc. to choose from and upstairs is an entirely different store- high-end housewares. \n\nYou will have to walk through many many times to take it all in as they have quite a bit of space compared to many of the small Kerrytown retailer spaces.  The selection is vast, so you'll need time to take it all in.  *Hollanders is an experience.*  You don't just dash and grab like you're at Walgreens, so plan on spending time there and enjoy the experience.\n\nBRING OUT THE ARTIST IN YOU\nEven if you're not an artistic, crafty type of person, one trip to Hollanders might make you want to take up some type of artistic hobby and run with it.  The blank card stock and stationary selections also might make you ditch the constant emailing and opt to put pen to paper- takin' it back to old school. \n\nIN SUMMARY\nIf you ever saw \"The Sound of Music\" (who hasn't?) and gotten all  crazed when Julie Andrews sang the line \"The Hills are alive with the sound of music...\", then you just might go into Hollanders and have the same experience she had- but from paper.

Rex captured my attention, it is one of the ten most complete T.Rex specimens on earth. They brought ancient animals to life! You can find out everything and anything you want to know about dinosaurs! Huge hall with 2 stories, you can have a very good view of the entire dinosaur hall upstairs. We are very into dinosaurs so we spent most of our time there, lots of questions were answered. The T. Rex growth series, how old are those dinosaurs, how the archeologists brought them to life, where they were found...very educational, and sooo cool! They have lots of other exhibitions too,  mammal halls, birds, insect halls, gemstone vault, archeological treasure, California history....etc, depends on what you like, you can spend more time there, I think it is gonna take a whole day to visit every hall thoroughly, it's just too much walking for me. \n\nThey have a cafe downstairs, good selection of food, snacks, healthy snacks, drinks, sandwich, burger... lots to choose from. It was great to sit down and have some food n beverages to recharge energy, we needed that for the visit! \n\nDon't forget to visit the museum stores, there are so many cute things, we got a few goodies at dinosaur store. :)\n\nThe staffs were very friendly and helpful. It was packed on a holiday Monday, lots of kids, family and couples. Great place for a family day, or date day, fun and educational!\n\nThey are currently doing many constructions both inside and outside, with that 13 million donation, they are gonna have lots of new things coming to this museum!

The theatre is this neat Tudor building with lots of brick and dark wood inside, which really makes you feel like you're taking a trip back in time, or at least across the Atlantic to a cozy pub/playhouse. I appreciate their traditionalist approach to Shakespeare, using Elizabethan costumes and music to help tell the story. They went to a lot of effort to make the play accessible and enjoyable for everyone, even people who haven't studied Shakespeare and who aren't quite able to follow the language. Midsummer had lots of physical comedy and some fun fairy special effects.\n\nThey offer $2.50 pints of Guinness, Bass, Newcastle, Strongbow and Sweetwater IPA on Friday nights, and they will make you black and tans for an extra English tavern treat. Food was decent -- chips and guac appetizer comes with an impressive mountain of tasty dip.

Curiosity required me to try an order, so I did.  In this case, a momo is a steamed dumpling not unlike other Asian steamed dumplings.  The meat momo is full of \"meat\" (they don't say, but I think it was pork and/or lamb), vegetables, and some low-key spices.  Were the momos any good?  Sort of: the flavors were on the mild side, but the dish was reasonably satisfying.  The sauce served with the dumplings was mostly forgettable.\n\nThis is still a teriyaki joint, of course, so the plate of momos also included a cabbage and lettuce salad.  As far as teriyaki joint salads go, it was pretty good.\n\nTokyo Garden doesn't have any windows in the main restaurant area.  The mirrors try to make up for this, but the end result is decidedly cave-like.  That being said, it isn't as though anyone goes to the Ave looking for ambiance.  They deliver exactly as much of it as you'd expect.\n\nTokyo Garden isn't really worth a special trip just to get a momo, especially given that there's a full-fledged Himalayan restaurant in Ravenna, but it is an interesting diversion for the Ave.  You should at least consider giving it a try if you're walking down the Ave and hunger requires you to stop somewhere.", "business_id": "z7543gTRoewwvk72MwqvGg"},

This place must only stay in business because of college kids who need a 24-hour place within stumbling distance.\n\nThe worst part, though, was the service the second, and last, time I ate there. We were seated for at least 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged our presence. Our drinks arrived a few minutes later, but no one came to take our order for another 15 minutes. Knowing that the first time I'd eaten here, I hadn't enjoyed my food that much, I asked the waiter what the specialties of the house were. He couldn't tell me. He asked me what I liked. I said, \"I like food that tastes good.\" I don't even remember what he said after that, but I didn't get a recommendation. I ended up just picking something. \n\nAfter waiting another half hour for our food to arrive, a woman, who I can only guess was the manager/owner, told our server to check on our orders as tables of folks who came in at at the same time and after us had already finished their meals. The server ascertained that our order was not in the queue and assured us that he had told them what to prepare, and the kitchen was making it.\n\nEventually we got our food, and it was, as previously mentioned, nothing to write home about. I can safely say that my sandwich was among the worst sandwiches I've ever paid for, and the fries that came with it were limp, lifeless and...kind of cold. This after we'd been sitting there for at least an hour total. \n\nAfter we'd finished eating, we waited and waited, and had to ask for our check, twice. And then my dining companion had to stand up at the cash register to finally get the bill paid. I'd feel for the server if he had several big parties or something, but there really weren't that many people there.\n\nIf the food or the service had been stellar, I would have said that the City Cafe is a respectable establishment for what it is, but it was just a horrible dining experience all around.

Loud and obnoxious is basically the environment at this restaurant.  \n\nI have never had the urge to drop a $20 on the table to cover drinks and just walk out of a restaurant until my second trip to this dump.  My party of four had to sit at a table near the sauce station.  The extremely slow moving line and traffic from the sauce station basically had our dirty table surrounded by people on both sides.  It just isn't pleasant to try and eat with your face sitting at butt-level with a bunch of people who for some reason find the lines and crowds acceptable.  \n\nOn this same trip we decided to leave after having a salad.  The line was just horrendous.  The salad items are the same items you put in your food -- so I sat about 5 minutes waiting to get to the cucumbers -- which were just five feed down the line from where I was standing.  After that wait, and seeing the line grow just to get to the first stage of items to put in our bowls, we decided it wasn't worth the wait.\n\nI am not typically picky about food or the atmosphere of restaurants.  But I will never go to this place again and I encourage you to not go to this restaurant.  If you are a tween going out with 20 of your best seventh grade friends, then have at it.  If you are above the age of 18 you will probably not enjoy your time here, especially if it is busy.

Here's my visit. \n\nAmbiance: I learned from my future sister-in-law that the restaurant is owned by members of a local Reggae band and so hearing reggae music being played all night and seeing colorful artwork and tables throughout the place didn't throw me off. Yes, the decor and feeling of the place didn't really fit with the more upscale food and plates they are trying to produce, but it was relaxing enough and I didn't mind the contrast. \n\nService: There was one bar tender and one server. Both did their jobs and payed enough attention to the house and their guests. There were a few times I wanted more water or a drink refill or dirty dishes cleared but for the most part our server was fine. \n\nFood: I'm quite surprised with a lot of the negative reviews written about the food. Most low star entries talk about the blandness of the food and I found that to be far from the truth.\n\nKangeroo dip: Cheesy, gooey, creamy, delicious dip accompenied by well seasoned what seemd to be homemade tortilla chips. The portion is a humble one so our table of five could have used a second round but it nonetheless was a nice start to our meal.\n\nBasket O' Fries: Double fried french fries with three dips to choose from. An obvious nod to Belgian style fries and I was very happy with them. Even though I thought the ingredients listed in the description came already on top of the fries, I had fun alternating between the tasty side dips and enjoyed the texture of the somewhat smoky tasting fresh cut fries. Good stuff. The curry dip was my favorite but the chil mayo and garlic aioli were nice as well.\n\nBuffalo Whole Chicken Wings with Blue Cheese: A good wing with a good blue cheese for dipping. Not reinventing the wheel here. Just a nice buffalo wing. They do give you the whole wing so some tearing and pulling is called for which I'm not a fan of but not a big deal and nothing that will ruin the dish.\n\nBaltimore Whole Chicken Wings with Ranch: This wing was different and delicious. The old bay seasoning was all over the chicken giving it a dry rub texture and feel. The taste is tangy with a little kick that goes great with the juicy chicken and creamy ranch. A delicious treat. This is the type of wing to get and I will certainly be getting them again in the future.\n\nBeet and Goat Cheese Flat Bread PIzza: Didn't have a bite of this one but my wife enjoyed it so much she didn't even offer.\n\nFish & Chips: Took a bite of my brother-in-law's fish and it was nice. Good texture and flavor. The fish is a whole fillet on the plate so the presentation was impressive. Not sure if I would personally spend $17.50 for fried fish not mattering the quality though.\n\nDrinks: Their drink list is impressive and shows off a lot of local beer but also beers from micro brews around the country. My first drink was Ithaca Beer Co.'s Cascazilla. A real nice hearty, sort of sweet, hoppy red ale. Several levels of flavor and it helped me forget the poor showings from Scale House I experienced the day before. For my second drink I wanted the Mad Elf but much like any restaurant with a large drink list there is a high chance things may be sold out and that was the case with this one. Instead I followed my Northwest roots and got a Red Hook Wit. A belgian style beer that was light and refreshing with hints of ginger. It was very tasty and I also liked the more stout looking bottle the beer came in. It's nice to see Seattle being represented in the beer list and Northstar choose a good one to do so. \n\nLast thoughts: Really this place is a winner. With great food and good drinks there's little I would want more. Sure the feel of the place is somewhat off and the service wasn't spectacular but that can't stop the fact that I enjoyed myself very much and would for certain would come back here. I'm already planning on treating my brother-in-law and his fiancee to a Northstar meal the next time I'm back in town.", "business_id": "k9UObyytIt6xmo-vzdpPdg"},

EyeQ got two visits out of me. I saw Dr. David Luria during both trips.\n\nBack in 2004 I was an contact-lens-only wearer. Things went well - appointment, exam, payment. If you wear contacts, you know that in order to purchase lenses with other vendors, you have to submit numbers like lens power, base curve, etc. As I paid, I noticed that the numbers were different on two separate documents they handed me - both written by Dr. Luria. I pointed this out, and one of them said:\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about it -- here I'll just fix that,\" \n\nand randomly grabbed one form to change the numbers to match. To this day I don't know if he picked the right one. No one called for Dr. Luria; didn't seem like they cared, either. \n\nIn 2007, I returned, after trying a couple of other doctors in the area and not feeling the right vibe. Despite the above, I remembered that the EyeQ guys were extremely nice, so I decided to give them another try. I had also finally decided to get a pair of glasses, and these folks were notorious for having interesting frames that didn't make you look like a Level 56 Nerd. So I walked in on the day of my appointment:\n\nCounter folks: \".... hug everyone!\"\nMe: \"Mm? You guys giving out free hugs?\"\nCounter folk: \"Um. SURE!\"\n*HUGS*\n\nSo by now I was thinking, aw, I'm home. I then said, \"I'm looking for glasses that, how do I say this, uh, NOT make me look even more Asian.\"\n\nAnd they totally got it. So some pairs were tried and I found my glasses, which I like (don't love - but like enough to wear, which is quite an accomplishment) to this day.\n\nGoing well so far! Next: appointment w/ Dr. Luria. He performed a few tests, and said he would like a follow-up test in a couple of weeks, that he was concerned about one of the test results. We scheduled that. \n\nTwo weeks later, we did the test again. \n\n\"Looks great! Results are much better. There is one more thing,\" and he went to put some eye drops in my eyes for reasons I can't recall. At which point he stopped short and said, looking a bit startled,\n\n\"Oh. Did you have contact lenses in during that whole test?\" (The test two weeks ago was sans lenses. I considered bringing this up, but decided he was going to be staring at my eyeballs all through that test, therefore would see them, and deduced he wanted them to stay in.)\n\n\"Um, yes.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, we should have taken them out for the test.\"\n\nNo mention of re-testing. I was given the eye drops, sent home. I never went back. \n\nSo, here's an OPTOMETRIST who FAILED TO SEE THAT I'M WEARING CONTACT LENSES THROUGH AN EYE EXAM. I don't even have a good metaphor for this to try and be funny about it.

The food does remind me of cafeteria food, that is somewhat more inspired than say, a hospital.  The food is over-priced and does  not deliver.  I ordered a grilled crispy chicken salad that was supposed to come with butter lettuce, radicchio and blue cheese dressing, and bacon, in that order.  The radicchio was very much predominant, which made the whole thing very bitter and I was actually unable to eat it.  The blue cheese dressing was more aptly blue-cheese flavored dressing, at a stretch, since it was the consistency of non-fat milk, and there was not a speck of blue cheese to actually be seen, let alone a chunk.  It tasted like watered-down Wish Bone from a bottle.  When I told the waitress that the salad was actually awful, she argued, telling me that \"some people like it.\"  After she realized that I was not going to eat it, she offered to replace the radicchio with butter lettuce.  I should have held on to the chicken, which did initially live up to the description, crispy, thin sliced breast meat.  On the return, the chicken was underdone, in some places pink, so it was slimy.  \n\nMy son's meal, a vegetarian dish was as he described it, reminiscent of a cafeteria.  Or something that his roommate might have thought of and made as a thoughtful gesture.  The predominant ingredient was tofu, which was cooked to a rubbery consistency, so that it was difficult to cut or otherwise consume.  It was a large cube.  My husband's hamburger was ok, but when we got the bill, it was nearly $100 for what was essentially snack food for three, no real entree with say a large cut of meat to justify that tab.  Our drinks were not to blame, two of us had house mineral water, and the third, a single beer.  \n\nIn terms of the atmosphere, it was very noisy.  Had I not known better, I might have thought that we stumbled into a party for some toddlers.  We were seated in what I called the kid section, the location in front of the kitchen where there are long tables, that were full of young, unhappy diners.  My guess is that they did not like the food either.  I have no problem with kids, but apparently Friday night is the night to go out with the family in Palo Alto. \n\nFinally, about the service, the waiters are friendly, though largely unskilled.

I've been craving it since!\n\nCame here for a late dinner on a Tuesday night. I love vegan food, but there was something a little bit off about the food here - it felt kind of bland and uninspired, even though tastewise, the food was decent. The portions are very generous but the food is just kind of boring (albeit filling). \n\nThe chopped vegetable salad falls into this boring category... it was fresh and healthy but just had chopped carrots, peas, peppers, and tomatoes. At least the avocado was somewhat redemptive.\n\nThe TV dinner is an attempt at comfort food - the whole dish looked pretty unappetizing, and though the tempeh loaf turned out to be pretty tasty, it wasn't particularly impressive.\n\nIf anything, the macro plate / real food bargain was probably the best dish, and I would definitely order it again. It's a HUGE portion of food that could be split between two not-totally-starving people. It includes a pretty decent vegetable miso soup, corn bread with tahini miso spread (the cornbread was hearty but a bit on the drier side - also different from conventional cornbread in that it's made of brown rice), as well as a huge plate brown rice, arame seaweed (so good), steamed veggies (boring but then again they're veggies), garbanzo beans, a delicious cabbage salad (somewhere between cole slaw and sauerkraut), and pickled beets! A lot of good flavors, a lot of healthy ingredients, and more than enough food to go around! I did like that there were so many choices for dressings and ALL of them were very good (I liked the cilantro lime and the Thai peanut a lot). \n\nThe service was a bit slow and disorganized, but at least our waitress was nice and acommodating. Given the number of vegan-friendly places in LA, I'm not sure I would come here again, but the food was pretty decent and fresh. Conclusion: this place is good for a healthy and clean meal, but it might not blow your socks off. If you go, get the Real Food Bargain and the lemonade!\n\n(On a side note, we had a strange experience while dining - three elderly people seated nearby us came to our table, started commenting on our food, and then asked if they could take pictures of our food... we said yes, mainly because it would have been difficult to say no - but it was strange and a bit annoying to say the least!)", "business_id": "ogFn9-iNXcJ4yFiN5ZsPow"},

I don't get why people say Ikea stuff won't look good in suburban homes. Just cause you live in the burbs dont mean you have to buy from Pier 1.\n* Those dolly cart things are fun to ride on.\n\nCONS\n* Very crowded.\n* Everyone and their gramma will own the same stuff you do.\n* Terrible for people who have no patience and hate putting things together.\n* It's very DYI. You see what you like, you find it in the warehouse, you ring yourself up, you haul it home. The staff will help out with stock questions but that's probably about it.\n\nTHINGS WORTH BUYING\n* Desks. They have a variety of table tops and legs that you can mix & match.\n* Storage units. Cute tin canisters and plastic container that are just as nice as the Container store but way cheaper.\n* Textiles. They have nice modern prints and curtains that are affordable.\n* Plants and pots. \n* Lighting.\n* Rugs. We found a nice neutral-colored one with nice texture for $150. But not all of it is nice.\n* Sheets, duvet sets. \n* All their kids stuff is cute\n* Kitchen stuff. My friend redid her kitchen and got the cabinet units from Ikea. It looks fabulous.\n\nTHINGS NOT WORTH BUYING\n* Couches, some chairs.\n* Bookcases. If you have a lot of heavy books, the cases will sag.\n* Mattresses. Not comfortable.\n* Blankets, pillows. Overpriced. Go to Home Goods. Their decorative pillows however, are not bad.\n* Art section. Sure generic furniture is ok but art is one thing you should be selective about.\n\nTIPS\n* A trip to Ikea is never an in an' out experience. Be prepared to walk, even if you just go to the market place floor and not the showrooms.\n* It's more fun going with other people. You never know when you'll need someone else to help lift things. \n* In an effort to cut down on using paper/plastic bags, they will charge you 5 cents for bags. So either bring your own or be prepared to lug your shit in your hands. Again, having a friend is a good idea.\n* Having a big car is recommended. Otherwise they have twine so you can strap things to the trunk or roof. Master Boy Scout knot-tying techniques.\n* Go online, if you see things you like, check the stock at the Altanta store BEFORE you go. Sometimes I call the store to make sure.\n* Check out their \"as is\" section near the checkout. It's mostly crap but once in a blue moon they do have bargains.\n* Check Craigslist often, because people are always putting Ikea stuff on sale there.", "business_id": "eKSSsmq0JKOtxYHcCEeGAg"},

It's written all over their menu.  Now I'm not really sure what it says, cause I can't read Asian, but people in the know have informed me that it's all just a big ruse.  Let me explain:\n\nWhile the Russians and United States poured all their resources into their nuclear and space programs in the 60's, Chinese scientists were hard at work developing and perfecting the greatest meat subsitute the world has ever known - Protein 2000 (the name of which, while dated now, probably sounded much cooler in the 60's...).  So while your parents were dropping LSD, they toiled away creating the fried vegetable protein that we know today.  But it wasn't until well into the 70's that they added the P2000 sauce, which it turns out is a by-product that resulted from one of the Chinese nuclear-physicists trying to synthesize liquid awesome.  \n\nThis all remained a big secret throughout the 80's, until one of the leading scientists on the project (and founding proprietor of Veggie Heaven) fled China to Texas with the schematics in hand, but not before changing the originals so that the P2000 secret would be lost to the Chinese forever.  Now the Chinese didn't like losing decades and billions of dollars worth of research, but what were they going to do?  Invade Texas?  However, in recent years, there have been talks of extradition, so the people at Veggie Heaven work hard to make sure that anti-Chinese-government sentiment remains high.\n\nBefore that comes to a head, I highly recommend that get your ass to The VH and try this stuff over a bed of rice and broccoli.  You've never eaten non-animal that tastes more like animal in your life.  And If you order it to-go, they fill up a separate Asian to-go thingy with each ingredient (the rice, broccoli, and P2000) - it's enough food for two people.\n\nEpilogue:  The Chinese government still hasn't recovered.  Case in point: they plan on landing a man on the moon in 2020.  Seriously guys?  Well when you get there, can you do us a little favor and clean up some of the trash we left?

The verdict: this place is f@cking awesome. In short: top quality instruction with dedicated classes in boxing, kickboxing, grappling, MMA, wrestling, and strength & conditioning; a great environment and convenient location; and highly competitive rates.  \n\nThe Redline instructors have an unbelievable amount of knowledge and experience, some with professional records that are so impressive they would be almost unbelievable if you haven't witnessed their skills in person. (check out their bio's on the website) But records alone do not make a good teacher, and fortunately, the staff at Redline are amazing instructors as well.  \n\nOne thing you definitely won't find at other gyms is the instruction in the Chinese styles of San Da and Shuai Jiao. The former is a kickboxing style that, despite being relatively unknown in America, is particularly well suited to MMA in part due to its inclusion of take-downs. The MMA instructors at Redline also integrate Shuai Jiao techniques with more traditional Brazilian Jiujitsu moves, resulting in a holistic grappling style that is not only better suited to the 'ground and pound' reality of MMA, but one that can also catch BJJ practitioners off guard in grappling tournaments.  \n\nThe gym is ego-free and even the most talented fighters and teachers are very humble. The atmosphere is respectful and collaborative, with more experienced students offering advice and tips, and everyone is open to try new ideas. Importantly, the facilities are super clean and there are also plenty of changing rooms and showers - not to mention weights, cardio equipment, heavy bags, and a boxing ring (and soon a partial cage).  Whether you're just looking to get in shape, or you're interested in fighting competitively, Redline is hands-down one of the best gyms in the area, and I would encourage anyone who is interested to come in for a trial class.", "business_id": "6EB64SrQIE-QZx_kZN_1jQ"},

I do most of my Urban shopping online, but because their brands are each sized so differently (and, unfortunately, many things just don't look right on my body type), I end up returning or exchanging a lot of things to this store. They are always so nice and helpful. If I want to exchange an item for a different size and they don't have it (often the case since, as I said, selection isn't great) they call another store and have it mailed to my house, without charging for shipping!

I stayed here recently for a friend's wedding and was extremely pleased with my stay.  The decor is beautiful (in particular, I compared it with the Hyatt Santa Clara, where i also stayed recently, and which has much more dated decor), and their Heavenly beds are, yes, heavenly.  I normally hate hotel beds, but I slept like a baby at the Westin (though that could've been due to the copious number of gin and tonics I had at the wedding reception).  The rooms are sizeable, and the bathrooms are *amazing*.  The shower has dual heads, and the bathtub is detached, like some sort of class-ay master bath or what have you.  My only complaint (and reason for the one star deduction) was that it took about 10 minutes for the water in the shower to warm up to a suitable temperature.  However, my friends who stayed in a different room had no problem with their shower, so it was probably just the pipes in my room.\n\nThe pool area, as others have mentioned, is quite small, so don't expect to get your lap swimming in.  I didn't go for a dip, but my friends did enjoy the hot tub.  We also liked the nearby bar/lounge area, where we spent a significant amount of time lying around on couches and chatting.\n\nThe location of the hotel is prime -- just a few minutes walk from the Caltrain, downtown Palo Alto, and a huge upscale mall.  It was super easy to grab some local eats -- and for my friend to buy slacks when he realized that he forgot to bring his suit!  (The mall was so close that he managed to run there, buy pants, and make it to the wedding ceremony before anyone else showed up.)\n\nRunners will be happy to know that Westin has teamed up with Runner's World to provide a map of trails around some of their hotel locations.  The front desk gave me a small playing card-sized map of 3-mile and 5-mile trails circling Stanford University, which I happily used for my Saturday morning long run.  I had a great run and a great weekend, and I'd definitely stay here the next time I have reason to be in the peninsula area.", "business_id": "kYZQy3PC3E0evgQBrGnbQQ"},

When I come in for a late lunch (145pm) on a weekday but still have to wait almost 30 minutes for food, and then come back for lunch another time and the parking lot is full... sorry... I love your food, but you are just not worth the hassle anymore TRCB.\n\nThere's a new place in town called Hot Stix which is the same type of restaurant, with the same great food but a lot less of a wait. Its located in the new retail complex at Lindbergh.\n\n=== Original review:\n\nRecently, Atlanta finally got a real mongolian BBQ. Way to catch up with the rest of the country! (Don't try to claim that roach motel up in Cobb is a mongolian bbq)  I've eaten at numerous Mongolian BBQ places in other cities, including chains like BD's, and several independent restaurants. \n\nThe Real Chow Baby beats them all on the dizzying array of vegetables, sauces and noodles/rice available for your dish, plus they offer several options such as making your dish into a wrap or serving warm bread with it, etc. The one place where I felt TRCB was weaker is in the selection of meat. Last time I went there it was beef, chicken, sausage, and something seafood (forgot what)... but no sliced pork?! \n\nRegardless I've always been pleased with the dishes I've made. :)\n\nThe other thing I like less about TRCB is the wait time. The lines can seriously be 20 minutes or more just to get your food to the cook, then you add in the time waiting. \n\nIts a reasonably cheap meal, always exactly what you wanted, and free valet parking.", "business_id": "3ejW1TGlpSVhaspKversrw"},

And after many months of anticipation and a perfect afternoon at Lacy Park, I knew the time was right.  Not only that, but the 15 minute parking spot right in front of THE FACTORY was open.  We were meant to be.\n\nSince it was during the week and still relatively early, the selection was amazing.  I picked up a mixed berry and peach cobbler.  I tried the peach first because I don't like peach.  Why did I buy peach if I don't like it?  I thought it would change me... but it didn't.  The peach cobbler was just \"eh\" but I would say that about anything containing peaches so don't trust me.  On the other hand, I spend more time craving berry cobbler than I sleep so I know a good one when I taste it.  It was mind-blowing!  I took a single bite then scurried home and threw it in the oven (350, covered in foil for about 10 minutes) and then slathered it with plenty of vanilla ice cream.  The tartness of the berries combined with the sweetness of the ice cream was pure bliss.  I would have eaten the whole thing if someone wasn't watching me...\n\nDid I mention that the young woman who helped me was wonderful?  I didn't... but she was.\n\nUpdate: My boything went to GCF to get me a cobbler surprise and showed up with one blueberry and one mixed berry cobbler.  Thank you and I love you for that.  Both were sickly delicious, as expected.  Also, he's 6'7 and he told me the woman working called him \"Shorty\" multiple times.  Hilarious.  This place could only get better if I lived there.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to note earlier that all of the cobblers are made with fresh fruit and no preservatives.  Also, on my most recent visit, I ordered a 8x10\" mixed berry cobbler (feeds 6-8) for $25.  You give them the time you'd like to pick it up and they have your piping hot cobbler read for you.\n\nUpdate again:  So GCF called me to tell me my cobbler would be an hour late.   I came in an hour later and it still wasn't ready.  They were very nice and apologized in the form of one free small order of gumbo which I thought was really nice!

The greens were doused in oil needlessly since the moist confit provided plenty of fat with which to enjoy the tender leaves.\n\n\"Lettuces\" was simply that and nothing more.

I was so happy to figure out the reason and found  a solution to my low energy level during the day.\n\nI told them my budget, which was under a thousand and the bed was much more than that. Since this was a family owned business, they were able to offer me a great deal at a  fraction of the cost the high chain ends were offering me. For a similar mattress, it was double the price at Sears and Macy's. They worked with me on the price and even offered me two pillows for my queen size bed. Since it was a high end bed, they also threw mattress protectors. It was very cool- stain and water proof. \n\nDeliver service what very accommodating. They were available for me after my work schedule. They have many deliveries days. I got mine delivered free. They took my old mattress away and two men brought my new mattress in and set it all up for me. They were very careful with my house, which I was surprised. Friendly service from beginning to finish. \n\nI told my family about it and my sister and mom bought one as well. Give them a shot first before you invest in a mattress.

The program was a really small, intimate group of 12 and classes are conducted in French in Paris at the Reid Hall campus (with mandatory classes taken in French universities). \n\nFor anyone considering this program here are my thoughts.\n\nPros:\n-In Paris\n-Takes three semesters for the MA; from Sept Y1-Oct Y2\n-Small class size, students are well vetted and you really feel like you are among your academic peers\n-Some of CU's, France's and the UK's best and brightest (and well published) profs \n-Campus is small but beautiful and has many a quiet area for study\n-Semester three is all about writing the thesis; there are no classes (even though you pay for the semester, so this could maybe be a con) so you could conceivably get a job and/or travel while writing\n-Very nice/helpful administrative staff at Reid Hall\n\nCons:\n-Very literature focused for a \"cultural studies\" program; this could have something to do with the French view of cultural studies, but as a sociologist, it was frustrating to have to keep explaining what I wanted to write my thesis on and to fight for a thesis advisor that was not a literature professor, but (in my case) an urban sociologist\n-The dean is pretty hands off, so look elsewhere if you encounter problems\n-There's not a ton of special financial aid (one merit scholarship, based on French language skills, I believe), but it's only three semesters \n-Had some difficulty with the guy who has the racket on housing, but after complaining (a lot) I was moved to another apartment after 6 weeks\n\nIf you do decide to do the program, I would recommend looking into the CAF (aid the French gov. at least used to provide for all students, even foreigners); getting an apartment on your own to avoid the overhead of the guy who's in charge of the apartments (it's not as hard as it sounds; the entire city basically illegally sublets with little problems); and if you plan to work at all, you can plan around knowing that semester three has no classes just the thesis to write.", "business_id": "fco4qToL2DhnVamv0yaW4w"},

If we are lucky enough, however, sometimes fate will bring us to the best choice.\n\nMy experience at Tintura was incredible, considering they had done their best to save my hair. Here's the background story:.\n\n     Earlier in the afternoon I had had a dreadful experience at another salon (Salon Bloom). My hair was completely destroyed - considering the hairdresser had literally chopped off the top of my hair into a bob, and kept the bottom of my hair (which was to my mid-back) untouched. The hair cut cost me $85, and it literally looked my hair went into a war zone with the top half and the bottom half on opposite sides of the battle field. I was devastated and drove to the first hair place that could I find. \n\n     I drove into the Claremont Village and saw that Tintura's door was open. I walked in, red and puffy from a cry fest which had ensued for hours. Doris, the owner, greeted me. I told her that I had just come from a haircut and was extremely upset. She sat me down to look at the cut. She realized that my hair was a disaster and needed a good fix. Unfortunately, she told me, that the salon was closing within the next few minutes and that I could set up an appointment for the week, considering that they were booked. I told her I understood and was dismayed by yet another unfortunate event. Instead of sending me off, Doris kept me and asked her master stylist, Danielle (if I am not mistaken), if she would stay later. From the kindness of both of their hearts, they agreed to keep the doors open for just a little bit longer to fix the disaster ensuing on my head. Doris and Danielle were in the midst of clients, when they looked to see how they could fix my hair. They examined the angles, the different possibilities, and all through which, they were incredibly sincere and genuine. I waited for a few minutes, until Danielle was done with her current client.\n\n     Danielle was supposed to leave right after, but opted to stay to fix my hair. She talked through my choices and recommended the ones which would be most favorable to what I needed. In order to save it completely, I needed a good chop, one which I was not willing to make, considering my hair had already gone through a brutal chop I had not asked for. She figured a way to calm the dreadful layer and adjust the length to better fix the cut. She warned that to completely fix my hair would take time because I did not want to snip off the hair I had been trying to desperately grow. She spent a good 45 minutes adjusting, texturing, blending, and doing everything she could to make my hair look like actual hair, versus the waves of disgust the other salon had shaped it to be. She literally saved my hair.\n\n     The entire time I was getting my hair cut, both Danielle and Doris were incredibly sweet and comforting. They were not pushy and kept laughing at my constant, apologetic behavior. I was beyond grateful. When it came time to pay, Doris gave me a 20% discount, considering the haste of my situation and all of the problems I had gone through. I finally left with a smile on my face. Even though my hair has not fully recovered, it is in the best shape it could be (under the circumstances), and was cut by a professional stylist who actually cared enough to make a girl feel good about herself.\n\nFrom the depth of my heart, thank you.", "business_id": "L6OpSiSJLgP6Jn7zJa_ZUg"},

I used to work here at this particular location, on and off for around 3 years. At first I loved it. (This may be due my previous 3 year employment in the Plaza food court. Needless to say, this was a step up.) Then I grew to hate it. (Don't worry though folks. I will not waste your time and review this poorly run company and the greedy corporate bastards that sent me in search of greener pastures. I will write a real review. But just in case you were wondering, this place is in fact run by buffoons.)\n\nON WITH THE REVIEW!\n\nIn all honesty, when it comes to shoe stores, RW is really as good as it gets if you don't want to venture into Nordstrom. And honestly, I NEVER want to venture into Nordstrom. And what RW has really accomplished, is the Nordstrom shoe department, in a shop the size of the Nordstrom women's restroom. Granted they're down to about half the inventory of Nordstrom, but the good stuff, the shoes you really want and look for, are all there. So It's Nordstrom minus all the crap. And minus all the FOB crap that Journey's carries. Not only is Journey's selection weak, but they only offer the kind of  colors that only the certain type of gentlemen who wear ill fitting saggy jeans, edge their hair and wear do rags, stroll in hoping  to find to match the brand new New Era cap they just purchased at LIDS. \n\nDon't tell me I'm wrong, because I'm not.\n\nAnd when they do have a decent color/style they almost never have your size. \n\nI happen to avoid shoe stores like Journey's and Sheik because I feel like the employees might actually mug me. There be some scary bitches up in there. And the Vans store employees? It's like their balls haven't dropped/ they haven't gotten their periods. I do not like asking a child if they believe I should go with the half size smaller because the canvas is going to stretch out enough over time. I'm sorry sweetie but a nod is not a real answer. At RW the customer service is still there. If there's one thing RW is known for, it's the ridiculous amount of customer service. During my initial training, my manager said they try to keep their customer service up to Nordsrtom standards. RW employees are schooled in footwear knowledge. I had to learn different type of toe styles, tread, and stitching as well as different types of leathers, cleaners, and how to properly fit a shoe. \n\nUnfortunately I have been back to this location and been disappointed with the customer service a few times. This made me a little sad because I remember the pride a lot of us took in knowing what we offered customers. (I GUESS we did have our moments where we left a not so kind impression on customers, but they deserved every bit of it, and we enjoyed every bit of it.)  I thought perhaps the company was loosing its old school emphasis on it's customer service. Luckily as of now, the current store manager is Adam. He is a delight and when dealing with his employees you can see his direct influence on them. Hopefully Robert Wayne continues to stay on track.\n\nHelpful Hints: \n-They don't give refunds! Store credit and exchange only. I know it sounds primitive, but their reasoning is that they most likely have something in store that will be to your liking, and if not you can special order from the vendor of your choice directly through them. \n- The employees work partially off commission, so be nice when they try to up sell. Its just part of their job. And all of the products really do work. That being said, sometimes we did lie about the fit/ availability to make a sale since there are not refunds. So go in with some common sense\n- Don't come here looking for out of this world deals. It's still the mall. But management does walk the malls on a regular basis and adjusts prices to keep up with competition. They also price match any competitor in the mall as long as the size and color are in stock. \n-They offer layaway which is nice. So you can purchase your UGGS in the summer and not rush to make what seems like a silly purchase considering the season, but isn't since that's when they really start loading up on winter inventory ;-)\n-They carry mens, women's, children, and baby sizes.\n-They are the absolute best place for Dr. Martens. THEE BEST. Hands down, from the in store selection to the special order process, RW is your best bet.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and say that Robert Wayne Footwear is a solid choice for your footwear needs.

This place rocks from the dive bar look to the beer selection to the Mac-n-cheese. If you love beer , this place will easily become one of your favorites in the Boston area. \n\nFood is interesting, fresh and always tasty. Service has always been attentive and helpful. We're familiar with most of the beers on draft but they've been helpful with some friends who know nothing about beer. \n\nIf your thinking about popping your Hobo cherry, don't be scared by the rather plain exterior. Inside the large red curtain this place is clean and neat. Just be warned it can get a little crowded standing around the bar. After our first trip we decided to try the food because it looked so good and the whole experience was better sitting at a table. \n\nThe only Bad thing I can think of here is the parking situation. It's a little bit of a hike from the T and most of the parking is permit only. Since I don't live in Cambridge this has been a little frustrating but I don't see anything the Hobo crew can do about that.", "business_id": "A3D8gBGNmt51kvcI0GkaGQ"},

I've been here five days a week for a year and have only had to wait to use a treadmill twice, which is awesome. Same deal applies for weight machines, spaces in class, showers, etc.\n- The front desk staff are, for the most part, incredibly friendly and accommodating. A few staff members in particular go out of their way to greet me by name every time I come in, and the overall customer service is great.\n- The gym is very accessible for those working in the Kendall area - in fact, there is virtually no competition in this neighborhood.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The layout of the gym is just plain awful. While the building has some \"industrial era\" charm, equipment is spread out into so many disparate places not by design, but by necessity, so doing a multi-part workout sometimes involves walking up and down hallways and multiple staircases in between segments. Additionally, the spin studio is only accessible through the aerobics studio, and neither is effectively soundproofed for competing noise (and basketball/racquetball noise from outside).\n- Repairs and upgrades to equipment... not so much. The facility is in terrible need of a remodel; the locker rooms in the basement are constantly flooding when it rains, the floor in the aerobics room creaks, and there is some equipment that is way past its prime. Improvements to the infrastructure don't seem to be high on CAC's priority list.\n- The class instructors appear to be very poorly vetted. Many are robotic and repetitive - one spin instructor in particular used the same playlist for every class for about four months straight. Some instructors may not be properly certified. Very few take the time to go over safety or setup precautions at the start of class, and even fewer take the time to interact with students individually to correct form. A shining exception to this trend is Ellen, who teaches Vinyasa yoga - she is absolutely fantastic, well qualified and attentive as an instructor should be. However, there doesn't seem to be formal procedure in place for evaluating classes or instructors, and the class schedule is changed only a few times a year. Group fitness is not a strong point for CAC in general.\n\nThe Ugly:\nI recently had a very bad experience with a Pilates instructor named Leah, who was outright rude and snotty to me, prompting me to send a letter to the general manager. The lack of response so far is a sorry indication of just how little attention is being paid to the member experience in group fitness classes at CAC, and how little effort seems to go toward ensuring that all instructors are qualified in terms of expertise, effectiveness, and professionalism.

So, I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco to visit a few friends, but also to try out Kara's Cupcakes.  Most of my friends who had ended up going here while in SF have all said it was better than Sprinkles, which I'm sure all of you know is my favorite cupcake place of ALL time.  Anyways, let me try and give as unbiased a review as possible, and you can judge for yourself.\n\nKara's Cupcakes has a few locations up in the Bay Area, and for all intensive purposes, is a mom and pop shop.   They are a purebred cupcake shop and not a bakery, so I respect that.  They offer a variety of cupcakes but their most popular cupcake is called the Chocolate Velvet, which is a \"chocolate cupcake with a velvety bittersweet chocolate buttercream.\"  Pretty awesome description.  According to the staff helping me pick cupcakes at 10am on a Sunday morning, their second most popular cupcake is the Sweet Vanilla, which is basically a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting.  No need for a detailed description there.  So, I ended up buying these two cupcakes to try out for myself, but also got a few extra so one of my friends, Monique, a fellow Sprinkle's fan, could also rate these cupcakes.  Since we both have basically the SAME tastes for cupcakes, let me share with ya'll what we concluded.\n\nOkay, so the Chocolate Velvet is a pretty phenomenal cupcake.  I was sitting in SFO with an Earl Grey tea and waiting for my delayed flight when I decided to devour this amazing cupcake.  This is basically a chocolate cupcake with a very light chocolate cream frosting, which is a perfect balance because it doesn't make it too overwhelming to eat.  The problem I have with most chocolate cupcakes is that it is just way too heavy and that I need a gallon of milk to comfortably finish one.  The cake was VERY moist and of perfect density, and the frosting was actually light enough where the chocolate flavor in the cake was stronger than the frosting!  That is quite unique, and I think this cupcake is definitely top 5 of all time of the places I have been to.  Monique says it is \"so light, yet chocolatey,\" and I completely agree.  This is just a cupcake that provides great balance, which I think is an important aspect that I feel like lots of cupcake places neglect (Crumbs is a place that fails miserably in this department.)  5 stars for this cupcake, and it's not number 1 because I am a bigger red velvet fan, but if I loved pure chocolate cupcakes, this would be top dog.\n\nAnyways, with high expectations now based on my first taste of Kara's with the Chocolate Velvet, I only assumed that the Sweet Vanilla would be just as good.  Oops.  This cupcake was actually, really bad, and I couldn't even finish it.  It is almost the completely opposite of the Chocolate Velvet, in that the frosting is way too sweet and heavy, and the cake was not that moist either.  I won't go into much detail, but don't get this cupcake.  \n\nI wasn't able to try the Fleur De Sel, which is a chocolate cupcake filled with caramel, but got Monique one, and she said that it was pretty good- the caramel inside was a nice surprise, but it was a bit salty and still not as good as the Chocolate Velvet.  The next time I am in SF, I will have to try this cupcake, especially since my friend Debbie, a Sprinkle's hater, says it is awesome.  \n\nSo, what's my final verdict?  The Chocolate Velvet is a great cupcake.  Everyone should try it because it really is just well made with quality ingredients and provides a perfect balance of chocolatey goodness.  I am disappointed it doesn't offer a red velvet flavor, which I think is a gold standard for a good cupcake, but that is obviously a bit of personal preference.  It seems that this place definitely has potential to be just as good as Sprinkles, but without a more diverse selection of flavors that are ALL good, it still doesn't beat the king.  I still think that Sprinkles, Violet's Cakes, and SusieCakes in Los Angeles still have an upper-hand over Kara's, and still highly recommend these places.  However, my trip to Kara's does inspire me to try something new in the kitchen- I'm going to try and make a red velvet cupcake with a much lighter and fluffier cream cheese frosting.", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A"},

Ahhh, sunny SoCal! :)\nI was taken to lunch at RFD today by my dear friend. I have been a vegetarian for 30 years, and he thought I would like this organic vegan restaurant.  He was right. Normally, I am not a fan of vegan food. I have had more than my fair share of bad \"mock meatloaf.\" Imagine my surprise then when my meal turned out to be awesome--and that's not all.\nFirst I ordered a cup of Jasmine tea from our WONDERFUL server, Steva (Celtic for Steven). What a sweeheart he was. I am married to a Chinese man, so I am very picky about my green tea being good quality. It was very tasty, decent grade Jasmine. Steva made sure my water refills were hot, in a new cup, something I am keen on. Sounds picky I know, but it was a detail he picked up on, without my having to ask for. I like conscientious servers. \nFrom there, I decided on the BLT Wrap (which was hysterical, because normally I would not be caught dead eating a \"wrap\").  My friend ordered the Total Rueben. The food came quickly, to my delight, as I was starving. My plate was piled high with a wrap that consisted of a thin (yum) spinach tortilla enveloping proportionate amounts of dark lettuce (read: not a mountain of crappy iceburg), chopped tomatoes, tremendous, crispy seitan bacon and a lovely chipotle mayo.  It also came with a vegan Caesar that was delish. My friend wasn't as thrilled with his lunch, and I can see why (hence, the four stars). His Rueben was anything but \"total.\" It was a wee thing, very thin, with stringy looking sauerkraut, tempeh, some 1000 Island dressing (can't believe they still make that stuff) and a meager salad. It definitely could have been more bountiful, which we pointed out to Steva. Anyhoo, I ate my entire plate of food, except for the salad which I gave to my hungry friend. \nWe then decided to order the Gluten Free Double Layer Chocolate Cake w/Raspberry Filling to split. Glad I didn't order a whole piece. Just so-so. I'm a baker, and I found it lackluster. Plus, I work in a European bakery, so I'm used to top-notch pastries, so my barometer isn't really unbiased, in fairness to RFD. The only other thing we commented on was the God-awful Muzac playing in the background.  Eddie Money???  Seriously? How about some jazz? Something unobtrusive. Or light classical? Or contemporary music?  Even hip hop would be fine. But EDDIE MONEY?? \nIn summary: the space is lovely, the food is good, the service we got was excellent, the prices were high but my food was plentiful and after all, this is SoCal and it is organic vegan food, so there ya go.  It ain't Taco Bell.  I definitely recommend this place, and I would definitely go back.  Thank you RFD for a nice experience and a nice afternoon!  :)", "business_id": "ogFn9-iNXcJ4yFiN5ZsPow"},

BREAKFAST TACOOOOOOSSSS.\n\nSo the coffee here: consistently good, and I've never had a cup that wasn't fresh-tasting or adequately hot. I also really like their selection of tea. I don't know what brand it is, but they have really interesting ones like ginger-peach-blah blah blah and I think I saw a \"flowering\" tea on the menu that I have yet to try, since I'm usually pressed for time. I don't usually drink lattes or other milky stuff but I once had a mocha that was pretty good. \n\nAnd the breakfast tacos are yummmmmy. You can order 2 3-ingredient tacos and a coffee or tea for $5, and they custom make your tacos! No old eggs sittin' around getting gross. Plus they really don't take that long - maybe 10 minutes at the height of their morning rush, but usually more like 5 minutes. I like their ingredient options - they have things like organic spinach, avocado, and really good whole-wheat tortillas, in addition to standards, so you can mix it up. Recommended: avocado, potato and cheese, or spinach, egg and cheese. Their salsa is also pretty good but comes in those annoying and wasteful tiny containers.  While I know that having a big bowl of salsa out might violate some health codes or something, I really hate throwing away plastic needlessly. \n\nIn addition to breakfast tacos, they have bigger plates of breakfast food and other cafe standards like pastries and cookies and little cakes and stuff. I've tried their croissants (made by a local bakery, I forget which one), which are ok...not that memorable. \n\nThe seating arrangements are nice. They have a variety of tables and couches, so you can have your pick whether you're working on a laptop or just settling in for a sit-down.

Just a note about that (and the reason I deducted a star): when my mac & cheese is in a literal block form (see attached photo), I expect there to be some powerful taste of the cheese and grease variety. After all, why would there be the necessary amount of cheese and grease to hold it together if it didn't? This, on the other hand, was pretty bland. Yeah, I said it. Even with all of the rave reviews of the mac & cheese on here, I didn't think it was all that impressive.\n\nI started to get a little nervous at this point, but once I took my first bite of the southern fried chicken, my looming anxiety evaporated. Perfectly cooked, juicy, and every bit as good as I was expecting. Even though I was full after the mac & cheese and the first chicken breast, I dove into the second and ate every last bite.

I wasn't very hungry, and the person  I was with wanted a good burger, and was paying, so I suggested MidAtlantic since we were nearby.  I ordered the MA Seafood Chowder and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I'm a huge New England Clam Chowder fan, and I have yet to find a version in Philadelphia that comes close to matching the hearty renditions I had savored throughout my years growing up near Boston.  Chef Stern's is as close as I've come to true New England clam chowder.  He doesn't pass it off as such, which I respect, but all the same he dishes out a very tasty soup.  My companion enjoyed her burger, save for the bun which she didn't like because it was greasy.  I have to say that I generally prefer a non-buttered roll with my burger, but there are always exceptions.  So keep it up, MidAtlantic!

I was greeted by a nice woman who said hello when I went into the store.  A person ringing up a customer who was taking a bit long apologized on her own to me when I was waiting in line for it taking a bit to long while they were trying to get a customer a credit card.  A guy working there was good at trying to find something which was close to what I was looking for but not exactly it, and also was able to suggest website etc.. There was no pressure from the sales staff, a woman also tried to show me what jeans they had in my size, but they weren't blue ones.  I think the only thing I was disappointed at was they were having jeans on sale but had been sold out of my size in the blue.  While gap clothing is nothing extreamly special the prices are reasonable and one thing I loved is they actually have an XS size, since I happened to now get smaller than small size.  I hardly see this size anywhere but they had it in there sweet pants even though I assume a lot of people aren't this size, so that was way kool!!! since the small ones didn't fit anymore.  \n\nThe new store layout is really neat, and they have a wide variety of items, and some dressy clothes.  I found other things I wanted there but didn't have enough money to get this visit unfortunately.  I felt that I would just like to say that the service here was so much better than when I've been in the downtown store, and the employee's actually seemed like they knew what they were doing!!  There were even no issues at the register and the staff didn't pressure me to much about the gap card.  I enjoyed my visit shopping at the u village gap even though they didn't have the size jeans I am in blue on sale that day.  \n\nEven though it is a little further, I can't just walk to it like the one downtown, it almost is more worth going there than downtown, but they do carry some different things sometimes so I guess it will all just depend, I enjoyed u village though a lot more.  I think though just to note that one thing I do like about the gap is its not over priced like abercrombie and fitch or other style stores so that makes it nice to be able to get clothing on a tight budget.  I think one thing that I'd like to see improved is more clothing that appeal to younger people or teens.", "business_id": "gNEYtpdIFx_4zEGczAwKPQ"},

Real NY style pizza?  Not quite.  Very good pizza that's quick and close by that I would order over the chains? And even over Cameli's, since I can just pick up from Vinny's, as opposed to wait for delivery?  This Lady Chinky Eyes says YES, absolutely!  Sauce isn't too sweet, the crust isn't too thick and has a good chew, and not gummy.  \n\nAnd who knew, the salads here are really good when I'm just too busy and hooongry to make my own, and very affordable too.  The $5 house salad is great, really good size, and I was able to add chicken for a couple more bucks.  Take that, Fresh 2 Order - you guys are good, but I'm not paying over $11 for one of your salads again anytime soon.  \n\nI'm still not a fan of the name (is there even a Vinny?), but this place is pretty good.", "business_id": "4U8Y6PllZ737Y-v65sIF_Q"},

When you're dealing with an allergy, \"the closest\" is NOT going to cut it. I was speechless and kind of confused, so I asked to see the chef. Instead, the manager came to the table, clearly pissed off that she had to talk to customers. She said that she would give me a tortilla with beans and cheese and lettuce. Then she said that there were no lard in the beans, so they're healthy (fyi, \"healthy\" does not mean gluten free) and then asked if tomatoes were gluten free. Um...WHAT? I don't care if you don't know what gluten free is: I'd be happy to inform you and give you the information you need to help people in the future. What I am not ok with is a manager being clearly upset that she has to answer questions and then saying that they can give me the \"closest thing.\"\nI did end up eating the bean tostada--the information I got out of her eventually led me to believe that it would be safe to eat.

The spinach and artichoke dip was not to be missed - delightfully buttery in taste.

Well 4 years of my life says yes.  MIT is an experience like none other...well that may not be right.  If you want the MIT experience at home, here is how you do it:\n1)grab lower lip, rusty nail, and peanut butter\n2)pull lower lip over top of head and pull until it is approximately ear level.\n3)hammer rusty nail into back of head, securing lip in position.\nMIT, home to some of the greatest minds in the world, has be likened to drinking from a fire hose.  I mean the most basic math course offered is calculus, that says something, right?  This is not your state school college experience: pulling all nighters to actually complete homework, having to stay awake in class and still not fully understanding the professor, and no naked mile.  On the topic of nudity, yes you can find it, and no, you don't want to find it.  There is a saying about MIT when it comes to the opposite sex (works both ways...what does that say about me?), 'The odds are good, but the goods are odd.'  Split into two campuses, east and west campus, one can go from a world of fake Louis Vuitton bags and over eager skinny frat guys, to one of sheer insanity (retinal scanners on doors, hot tubs that drive around, huge murals dedicated to pokemen (the plural of pokeman?)).  Not for the feint of heart this institution takes you as you are, beats you to a pulp, pours you into a genius mold, then pops you in the fridge over night to chill.\n\nMajors range from Architecture to Computer Engineering, having something for all tech-heads.  Most classes run 1 hour (three times a week) to 1.5 hours (twice a week) for lecture and additional time for recitation.  Looking to supplement your own education, whether you are at MIT or not, most people look towards MIT's OpenCourseware, a free internet database of the classes offered there.  In addition to always learning new things, it is common for students to work in a lab outside of class.  I built satellites in my free time with MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science, giving me the priceless skills of: using MATLAB, using machining equipment, breaking machining equipment, siphoning antifreeze with my mouth, visiting the hospital on a regular occasion, soldering.\n\nThe campus has recently been kicked up a notch with new buildings dedication to student housing, Neuroscience, and Computer science.  All the buildings are given numbers (as well as some names), which is what the students refer to them as (same goes for classes).  Inside note, all even buildings are on one side and odds on the other side.  Some of the buildings referred to by name are the Stata Center, all the dormitories, Richard Cockburn Maclurn, Ellen Swallow Richards, yes, those last two actually exist, I was surprised too.\n\nBottom Line: This very unpretentious school packs one hell of a punch.  Bring the antidepressants and enroll in Calc I (18.01).  If you choose Physics like I did, be prepared for a long haul, then grad school if you actually want to use your degree.", "business_id": "970s01xAU8Yv-lAQaBXvNA"},

Got the chicken tikka masala (probably the most recognizable/cliche item to order), aloo mutter, and some super spicy beef curry. The food was a lot better this time around; it was under-spiced, and I managed to get a taste of all three options without one over-powering the other. \n\nNote: The chicken tikka masala tastes JUST like the frozen entree you can get at Trader Joes. Don't know if that's just TJ being awesome, or BC being lame...\n\nThe curries are way too watery for my liking... so watery that the curries just kind of blend together to create a schloppy mess. Sure, they're supposed to be pretty soupy (to dip in your naan, I suppose?) but there's like no meat in there whatsoever.

First off, the Yard Sale (2 courses and a side for $25!) is a great deal. I had the corn and crab chowder as a starter, which was a bit of a let-down-- not super-flavorful or crabby and nothing special, really, though the cute stone-handled bowl it came in was a plus. My friend's crab cake starter was far more delicious (and far more crabby!) with a tasty salad and side cucumber-caper-sauce concoction. The spinach salad with chevre also looked amazing.\n\nI had the pulled lamb shank as my main course, and it was ok, though not what I was expecting-- it resembled more of a stew or cassoulet than a lamb shank as I imagined it, and as such, seemed better-suited for a robust winter meal than a summer supper in June. My friend's duck dish, though-- AMAZING! We thought the duck breast was delicious until we had the leg confit, which was far MORE delicious. Definitely get the duck. The sides were plentiful but nothing super-special.\n\nBy the time dessert rolled around, we were too full, and the dessert menu seemed overpriced after the Yard Sale steal. The check came with some ginger cookies though, so it was a win anyway. Bottom line for me: the Yard Sale is a bargain, but for the full price, not quite worth it, depending on what you order-- also, the service and ambiance is more family-restaurant style than I expected for a relatively fancy place.

The iced drinks (and all non-thermos coffee) has to be ordered from the same place as the sandwich line.  Stood in line for about 10 minutes watching two workers attempt to make two sandwiches for the people in front of me-- the main holdup seemed to be that one of them was completely stymied about what to do if she needed to make a small sandwich but had a large piece of bread.  Excruciatingly watched her contemplate cutting the bread into halves to make a smaller piece, putting it back, fetching it again, putting it back, asking her co-workers, getting a manager, and still not being able to figure it out after being told to cut it.  ???   Anyway, by then a bunch of other people had put their pieces of paper with sandwich orders up on the table.  Of course, there's no place on the papers for drink orders-- you just have to stand around and interrupt them to make sure they actually wait on you instead of grabbing new sandwich orders.\n\nOrder my drink (iced mocha), and after about 5 minutes, I'm handed a hot mocha.  Grrrr.  Ask if I can have some ice so that I can chill it myself-- they say no, they have to remake it, it will just be two minutes. I'm not really feeling like waiting to repeat this process, so just repeat the request for a cup of ice; no dice. Oh well. \n\nSo go stand in line to pay.

I know wavy fries are one of the lowest on the fry scale (with criss-cut/waffle fries at the very top), but for some reason, Bongo makes wavy fries like no other. They're perfect, and everything wavy fries should be. Not to mention that they offer a ranch dipping sauce, which is better than crack cocaine (it's a metaphor! i honestly wouldn't know). I usually need about 3.5 portions of ranch, 2 for my sandwich, and 1.5 for my fries. *licks lips*\n\nBongo makes me happy.

If you like burgers or drinks, mostly of the creative-take-on-the-classics variety, the menu will serve you well, and it's a worthwhile stop. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a burger, grab a tear-sheet menu and start concocting something good.  I enjoy the vegetable falafel option, as well as the standard beef burgers, but the turkey burger has occasionally been pretty dry.  The options to add to your burger are fun and run the gamut, including the style (or omission of) bun you'd like. Sides are relatively standard, while the appetizer selection is slightly more unique. \n\nThere are some fun drinks here - the Rhode Island Iced Tea and milkshakes (of both the for-everybody and adults-only variety) are recommended, and their beer list usually contains some less-standard selections worth considering (Otter Creek Black IPA and St. Rogue Red have been my choices lately).  \n\nServers are plentiful - service, sometimes less so; I'd hate to see them short-staffed.  There are many servers here who seem to portray they're giving you fifteen minutes on their way to something much more important.  I get it - the restaurant industry isn't your career goal, but if you took the job and showed up that evening, please give us a modicum of service attention. On the flip side, some of the people here are great...it's just hit or miss. The crayons and coloring place-mats are a good attention getter for kids that helps the adults get settled, get a drink, place an order, and settle in.  Well-played there. \n\nOverall, my wife and I like it here, my kids love it, it's a great place to sit outside and enjoy dinner on a temperate evening, and the food is good.  Service is a wild-card here, but odds are you'll have a good time.", "business_id": "szmLFKB_wzz3Fb4Tqg3r7g"},

Buy as many margaritas as you can drink before happy hour ends!  (7pm, but watch out, they will kick your butt)\n\nOver my years at school, I probably went there about 50 times.  It gets really crowded on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so if you don't like that, avoid those nights.  If you are looking for a bar near Columbia on a weeknight, this is the place, as the smaller space is more inviting and comfortable.\n\nThe food is great, and I have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner.  The food is a good deal, and pretty much everything on the menu is delicious.  The guys who work here are friendly and great!\n\nIt probably deserves 4 stars overall, but since I had so many great times here, and was never let down, it gets 5.", "business_id": "vHzWvZYbkoHY_071J-lPRw"},

It still looks a lot like the former restaurant Pangea, but I'm sure it will take on its own style soon.  My one piece of advice is to put some some picnic tables outside where you can get messy with the food.  \n\nTheir signature dish is the half-rack of ribs.  You can order them either wet or dry.  I was with a friend so we got both.  \n\nWe were pleased with both.  The sauce is sweet and spicy.  Meat was tender.  \n\nIf you need extra sauce they are more than happy to provide a pretty good pepper sauce as well as a selection of both homemade and bottled hot sauce.\n\nDecent sides include slaw, collards, corn cakes, etc.  Cornbread was a little dry.  But overall good selection.  \n\nThey have a great bar with tons of local beers to choose from.", "business_id": "uIhwJtKaUDXUm0_3RY6uRg"},

I ordered a black coffee and Angie's Famous Melt (Homefries, saut\u00e9ed onions,pepper, ham, smoked sausage, bacon, 2 eggs, any style topped with melted cheese) Let me say this, the portions are huge. My order was enough to satisfy two hungry people. The melt had a little too much potato for my taste(they put a lot ), but overall it was pretty good. The waitress mixed up my request for no ham with my friends and ended up giving me ham and leaving it out of his, however, she noticed this herself right away and asked if I wanted it remade, but it didn't matter enough for me to wait again. \n\nThe food did take a while to prepare (half an hour?), so just based on my experience, I would only go if I had time to sit down and enjoy my food. I also enjoyed the small town diner interior. I think it definitely added some character and charm! As another yelper mentioned it does have a very \"homey feel\".", "business_id": "KBSD-XNDRjWi7JCDK9IpMg"},

The tuna tartare was different compared to other places, it had a little tangy kick to it. The ebi soro was button mushroom with a shrimp stuffing. I prefer the fresh taste of the tuna tartare.\n\nFor rolls I ordered the shichi hako and the lotus, both were excellent. The shichi hako was a box type roll with a little bit of everything. The lotus was a shrimp tempura roll topped with snow crab, it's actually real snow crab, not imitation.\n\nAll the nigiri was very fresh, the uni especially. The o toro is one of the best in the area I have ever tasted. Not only was it good, it was way underpriced, $13 at the time, the price changes with the market.\n\nI had the lychee sherbet for dessert, tasty, palate-cleansing, and fresh.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice, chic, up-scale, and modern. The service was very friendly, knowledgeable wait-staff (mine was at least).\n\nWell, rounded sushi place, with price that is very affordable. The perfect choice for a first date restaurant.", "business_id": "CgUgaSo5GyM3bKCeY7edYg"},
